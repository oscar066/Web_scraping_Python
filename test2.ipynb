      "But all is not well within our so-called Urban Century. Rapid urbanization, rising gentrification, concentrated poverty, and shortages of basic infrastructure have combined to create spatial inequity in cities and suburbs across the globe. The challenges of housing, moving, and employing so many people have led to longer travel times, rising housing costs, and unsustainable public spending. Moreover, policymakers are questioning traditional policies and approaches.\n",
      "The past couple years, we’ve led a project at Brookings—Moving to Access—that responds to these spatial challenges by promoting the idea of connecting people to opportunities as a new foundational principle for 21st century urban development. This principle of accessibility is meant to be a corollary to the natural questions we ask ourselves everyday about the communities where we live: Is this the best location to access employment? Are there nearby schools and health services? Is there a market in the neighborhood? How can I get from here to there? Such choices are valid for those with sufficient income. But what about those with more limited resources and thus choices in terms of affordable housing and affordable transport?\n",
      "While economists, planners, and engineers have promoted accessibility for decades, the concept is more often found in textbooks than formal urban policies. In the first stage of this project, we worked with a team of experts to determine what has stalled practical implementation of appropriate policies and practices? “Delivering Inclusive Access,” a report of this initial work, offers a synthesis of what we found and where we believe researchers, policymakers, and practitioners can take this work next. The paper found three central challenges.\n",
      "The fallacy of the single indicator\n",
      "The current transport regime’s approach to measurement is one of outward elegance: The dominant pursuit is speed, and the primary way to measure it is congestion (or what slows us down). Many have come to label this approach a pursuit of “mobility.” It is seen through different, but often singular, measures of how congestion affects a specific roadway. Such singular measures are easily interpreted by policymakers and civil society and can be translated directly into economic analysis of related investments through timesavings. They also conveniently serve such purposes as the internationally agreed-upon Sustainable Development Goals. Yet they actually don’t answer the fundamental question of who can reach where, in how much time, and at what cost.\n",

      "Accessibility measures can answer those questions, but not through any one measure. First, the variable social, economic, and political contexts related to access mean searching for a single magical indicator is counterintuitive. For example, a wealthy, automobile-centric region like Dallas, Texas, may have very different measurable goals than a denser, poorer region like Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Second, academic literature is now rife with such complex measures that it could be difficult to communicate their methodology and results with practitioners. The development of a suite of indicators could offer a menu for policymakers and practitioners to judge accessibility based on local objectives, local conditions, and local capacity.\n",
      "The danger of excessive localization\n",
      "Decentralization and empowering local communities is fast becoming a mantra of governance experts across the world, from development practitioners at institutions like the World Bank to city-focused theorists. And for good reason: delegating policy design and fiscal authority directly to the local level helps ensure policies and practices respond to local needs and desires. Yet as urban areas spillover into contiguous and often numerous municipalities, local independence can introduce certain challenges, especially relating to social and environmental externalities. When it comes to transportation and land development, interests of one municipality are often different from its neighbors. And these divergent development goals can exacerbate accessibility challenges within growing regions, spreading people, housing jobs, and other activities further from one another.\n",
      "Addressing spatial inequities in land use and real estate markets require a broader approach to horizontal governance. While there are examples of metropolitan transport authorities, there is less willingness to consider metropolitan or horizontal governance of land use and fiscal policies. For example, should housing be coordinated across an entire region?\n",
      "Countries with a more centralized top down approach to governance, such as France and Germany, have greater ability to formulate metropolitan governance than more decentralized countries such as the U.S. This is not to say there is a one-size-fits-all approach, but there is an opportunity to test different solutions within different governance contexts, comparing how effective each model is to promote spatial inclusivity.\n",
      "The finance community is missing in action\n",
      "Financing is a central topic in infrastructure circles. As maintenance bills from the automobile era come due, populations continue to grow, and fiscal budgets are tight, how can urban areas afford to build enough infrastructure to support future economic growth? In response, new approaches are evolving in fiscal instruments, such as value capture and private-public partnerships. Missing in these discussions, however, are the implications for inclusive access.\n",
      "We conducted a multi-decade review of past academic literature on access and found that there is no clear substantive discussion of accessibility from a fiscal perspective. While urban transport and land use professionals clearly recognize their interrelationship in achieving inclusive accessibility, at least in theory, the fiscal and finance professionals generally ignore the implications of their instruments with regard to inclusivity. The multilateral development banks and their economic evaluations have ignored the distributive impacts until very recently. And the efforts of some countries to incorporate measures through multi-criteria analysis have had limited impact.\n",
      "This gap must be resolved in any effort toward inclusive urban development. There is little doubt that fiscal approaches must carefully assess who ultimately pays and that alternative finance instruments should be adapted to foster access for all.\n",
      "Going forward\n",
      "Our research confirms that there are enormous opportunities to advance accessibility theory into practice. At this point, what is desperately needed is to launch a range of case studies that deal with these issues and challenges under different geographic, governance, and economic contexts. The good news is that many initiatives are already underway, and more robust communication channels and technology can support such efforts. In Chicago, researchers created an online platform to visually explore accessibility by location. In Bogota, researchers evaluated how affordability is a key principle of access. And in Cairo and Kigali, researchers used open tools to achieve new insights for accessibility. Sharing the results of these case studies could lead to a new level of cross-disciplinary approaches to improve accessibility and lessen the effects of spatial inequity.\n",

While drawing on the principles that gird our economic and political systems to provide a well-rounded education, like law schools and business schools, policy schools provide professional training. They are quite distinct from graduate programs in political science or economics which aim to train the next generation of academics. As professional training programs, they add value by imparting both the skills which are relevant to current employers, and skills which we know will be relevant as organizations and societies evolve. \n",
      "The relevance of the skills that policy programs impart to address problems of today and tomorrow bears further discussion. We are living through an era in which societies are increasingly interconnected. The wide-scale adoption of devices such as the smartphone is having a profound impact on our culture, communities, and economy. The use of social and digital media and associated means of communication enabled by mobile devices is changing the tone, content, and geographic scope of our conversations, modifying how information is generated and consumed, and changing the very nature of citizen engagement. \n",

Surveillance for purposes of public safety via large-scale deployment of sensors also raises fundamental questions about information privacy. From technology-enabled global delivery of work to displacement and replacement of categories of work, some studies estimate that up to 47 percent of U.S. employment might be at risk of computerization with an attendant rise in income inequality. These technology-induced changes will affect every policy domain.

This toolkit needs to be supplemented by an understanding of how technology is transforming societal challenges, enabling new solutions, or disrupting existing regulatory regimes. This understanding is essential to policy formulation and implementation. \n",
      "Pillar 1: Design skills\n",
      "As with engineering, where design precedes analysis, this first pillar seeks to educate students in thinking creatively about problems in order to devise and develop policy ideas. Using ideas derived from design, divergent and convergent thinking principles are employed to generate, explore, and arrive at a candidate set of solutions. Using Uber as an example, an approach to identify and explore the key policy issues such as convenience, costs, driver working hours, and insurance would involve interviewing and observing both incumbent taxi drivers and Uber drivers. This in turn would lead to a set of alternatives that deserve further and careful consideration.  Using these skills, candidate designs and choices that are generated can be evaluated using the policy analytic toolkit. \n",
      "Pillar 2: Analytical skills\n",
      "At Carnegie Mellon, we are often cited in media and interrogated by peers on our approach to analytical and technology skills education. Curiosity about which skills are the “right” skills to teach policy practitioners are common, but we believe this is the wrong approach. We instead begin from the premise that policy or management decisions should be grounded in evidence.  We then determine the skills required to assemble the types of evidence that will likely be available to policy makers in the future.  In increasingly instrumented environments where citizens and infrastructure produce continuous streams of data, making sense of it all will require a somewhat different set of skills. We believe that a grounding in micro-economics, operations research, statistics, and program evaluation (aka causal inference) to be an essential core to policy programs. \n",
      "New coursework will teach students to work with multi-variable data and machine learning with an emphasis on prediction. This material ought to be part of the required coursework in statistics given the importance of prediction in many policy implementation settings. Along the same lines, the ability to work with unstructured data (especially text) and data visualization will become increasingly relevant to all students, not just those students who want to specialize in data analytics. Finally, knowledge of data manipulation and analysis languages such as Python and R for analytic work will be important because data often has to be massaged and cleansed prior to analysis. An important task for programs will be to determine the competencies expected of graduates. \n",
      "Pillar 3: Interpersonal experiences\n",
      "The third pillar of the skills-based model is interpersonal experience, where the practiced habits of good communication and steady negotiation developed with a sound understanding of organizations, their design and their behaviors. We label these purposely as experiences rather than skills because we believe they are best practiced either in the real-world or in simulated real-world settings. It is also in this pillar where practitioners learn the knowledge necessary to become credible experts in their domain. We believe that in addition to core coursework in the area, a supplementary curriculum which provides students with opportunities to gain these experiences is an essential component of our educational model.\n",

      "The ability to carefully diagnose the effectiveness of policy or management interventions is the fourth pillar of our model. It is insufficient to create and execute policy without measurement, and this is where both careful thought to the fundamental issues of measurement and evaluation become important. The ability to make objective judgments on the benefits, liabilities, and unintended consequences of prior policies is the goal of this set of skills. Here, sound statistical and econometric training with an understanding of the principles of causal inference is essential. In addition, program evaluation skills such as cost-benefit and financial analysis help practitioners round out their evaluation skills by considering both non-monetary and economic impacts.\n",
      "What should be retired?\n",
      "A skills-based approach might replace certain aspects of existing policy training.  This depends on a number of factors specific to each institution, but three generally applicable observations are clear. First, real-world experiences are a powerful way to encode domain learning as well as project management skills. Through project-based work, students can learn about institutional contexts in specific policy domains and political processes such as budgeting. Second, team-based projects allow students to learn and apply principles of management and organizational behavior. At Carnegie Mellon, we refer to these as “systems synthesis” projects, since they require students to adopt a systemic point of view and to synthesize a number of skills in their policy analysis toolkit. Third, interpersonal skills training can be practiced through activities such as weekend negotiation exercises, hackathons, and speaker series. These activities can be highly intentional and fashioned to reinforce skills rather than as a recess from the “real work” of classroom training. Since students complete graduate programs in such a short time, counseling them to focus on outcomes from day one will allow them to choose a reinforcing set of coursework and real-world experiences. \n",
      "In summary, we argue for a model of policy education that views practitioners as future problem solvers. Good policy education must consider the ways in which problems will present themselves, and the ways in which answers will obscure themselves. Rigorous training grounded in the analysis of available evidence and buoyed by real-world interpersonal experiences is a sound approach to relevant, durable policy training.\n",

      "TITLE: \n",
      "The government-sponsored housing finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (GSEs) were rescued with large taxpayer injections of capital and placed into legal conservatorship during the financial crisis of 2008. They remain in conservatorship today, controlled on a daily basis by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) with the Treasury Department’s legally binding agreement (PSPA) giving Treasury substantial legal authority to go along with its ownership of 79.9 percent of each companies stock. Brookings’ Center on Regulation and Markets convened a diverse group of housing finance experts to discuss the future of the GSEs. This is a recap of that conversation.\n",

      "Conservatorship was never meant to be a semi-permanent state. Over the years various reform proposals have been floated, including a bipartisan effort by then Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson (D-SD) and Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-ID), based on a proposal authored by the Bipartisan Policy Center said Dennis Shea, executive director of J. Ronald Terwilliger Center for Housing Policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. This proposal garnered significant momentum but did not make it over the finish line. Despite rumors that the Trump administration would recapitalize and release the GSE’s, they passed on the opportunity to fundamentally change the situation, instead pursuing a set of more moderate reforms. Many of these reforms, put in place under former FHFA Director Mark Calabria, garnered praise from unexpected sources including Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition and the Center for Responsible Lending’s Mike Calhoun.\n",
      "Calhoun, along with former bond trader Lewis Ranieri (often credited with inventing the mortgage backed security) authored a new comprehensive proposal to reform the GSEs and end the conservatorship. The Calhoun/Ranieri plan would institute a set of permanent reforms to the GSEs, ultimately releasing them back into operation to be regulated as utilities. In the process, the Treasury Department would sell off its ownership stake, freeing potentially $100 billion to be used to address affordable housing and promote homeownership, with a particular focus in addressing the persistent racial homeownership gap.\n",
      "One year after announcing their plan in a paper published by Brookings, Calhoun laid out his argument for why it still makes sense today.  Calhoun cited bipartisan support for ending the conservatorship as evidenced during the recent confirmation hearing for new FHFA Director Sandra Thompson. Calhoun argued that the Treasury Department had unwound its position from multiple other companies it bailed out under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), including AIG. Under Calhoun’s plan, FHFA and Treasury would work together to cement a set of modifications that would result in the GSEs operating in a utility-like model that could not be unwound by future administrative action. FHFA would continue to regulate the GSEs after Treasury had sold off its ownership.\n",
      "The sale of Treasury’s position would generate up to $100 billion, Calhoun estimates. This money could be used for a variety of housing purposes without additional Congressional action. It is unusual for the administration to be able to generate $100 billion to use without Congressional appropriations, and with President Biden’s Build Back Better initiative struggling in Congress, it is hard to see another path where federal resources of this magnitude would be dedicated to promoting affordable housing or addressing the homeownership gap. The status quo system is producing very disparate outcomes across America by race. Data shows that GSE supported loans in New York in 2020, for example, were skewed 17 to 1 for white Americans compared to Black.\n",
      "Margaret Franklin, vice president at Fulcrum and also a local government official, equated Calhoun’s paper to the “blueprint for housing affordability,” emphasizing the need for action on a local level. Shea highlighted the importance of supply side constraints for affordable housing, which is often the result of local zoning regulation (for more on this see Brookings Senior Fellow Jenny Schuetz’s new book “Fixer Upper”). Yentel agreed on the need for more funding for housing, and offered the idea of distributing the new money through the existing the National Housing Trust Fund. She also stressed the importance of ensuring that some federal investment go toward aid for affordable renting housing for low-income Americans. All panelists echoed her on the importance of rental housing, highlighting the interlocking nature of housing between homeownership and rental.\n",

      "Bryan Greene, vice president of policy advocacy from the National Association of Realtors agreed on the importance of a financial market utility model. He pointed out that among the congressionally chartered duties of the GSEs is closing the racial homeownership gap. If the GSEs were to be reformed administratively, without explicit legislation, he made clear the importance of endorsing a utility model.\n",
      "The conversation closed with the question of whether we can afford to wait for GSE reform. Panelists agreed that urgent, bipartisan action is needed. Greene borrowed a Monty Python quote—“It’s not dead, it’s just resting,” —to highlight the opportunity to resuscitate this debate. Brookings moderator Aaron Klein quoted his former boss Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner’s favorite motto: “Plan beats no plan,” and encouraged those who think there is a better alternative to Calhoun/Ranieri’s proposal to come forward. Ultimately, the panelists agreed on the urgency of the issue and desire for action.\n",
      "Coming out of the event the question remains whether Congress is capable of legislating on GSE reform absent additional crisis. Stability in housing finance is important for the economy and for American families, as for most American’s their house is the largest asset. If Congress cannot legislate, is there a path for administrative action that creates stability for the housing market, opportunity for those seeking homeownership, and garners bipartisan support? Calhoun’s plan is out there testing to see if it can thread those needles.\n",

      "TITLE: \n",
      "Open-source software quietly affects nearly every issue in AI policy, but it is largely absent from discussions around AI policy—policymakers need to more actively consider OSS’s role in AI.\n",
      "Open-source software (OSS), software that is free to access, use, and change without restrictions, plays a central role in the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI). Across open-source programming languages such as Python, R, C++, Java, Scala, Javascript, Julia, and others, there are thousands of implementations of machine learning algorithms. OSS frameworks for machine learning, including tidymodels in R and Scikit-learn in Python, have helped consolidate many diverse algorithms into a consistent machine learning process and enabled far easier use for the everyday data scientist. There are also OSS tools specific to the especially important subfield of deep learning, which is dominated by Google’s Tensorflow and Facebook’s PyTorch. Manipulation and analysis of big data (data sets too large for a single computer) were also revolutionized by OSS, first by the Hadoop ecosystem and later by projects like Spark. These are not simply some of the AI tools—they are the best AI tools. While proprietary data analysis software may sometimes enable machine learning without the need to write code, it does not enable analytics that are as well developed as those in modern OSS.\n",

      "That the most advanced tools for machine learning are largely free and publicly available matters for policymakers, and thus the OSS world deserves more attention. The United States government has gotten better at supporting OSS broadly, notably through the Federal Source Code Policy, which encourages agencies to release more of the code they write and procure. Yet the relationship between OSS and AI policy goes less acknowledged. Trump administration documents on AI regulation and using AI at federal agencies mention OSS only in passing. The Obama administration’s AI strategy notes the important role of OSS in AI innovation, but does not mention its relevance to other issues. A new European Parliament report states that European OSS policies lack “a clear link to the AI policies and strategies… for most countries.” In fact, the recent proposed European AI regulation does not address the role of OSS at all.\n",
      "Generally speaking, analyses and international comparisons of AI capacity often include talent, funding, data, semiconductors, and compute access, but often lack a discussion of the role of OSS. This is an unfortunate oversight since OSS quietly affects nearly every issue in AI policy. AI tools built in OSS enable the faster adoption of AI in science and industry, while also speeding proliferation of ethical AI practices. At the same time, OSS is playing a complex role in markets—powering innovation in many areas, while also further empowering Google and Facebook and challenging the traditional role of standards bodies.\n",
      "1. OSS speeds AI adoption\n",
      "OSS enables and increases AI adoption by reducing the level of mathematical and technical knowledge necessary to use AI. Implementing the complex math of algorithms into code is difficult and time-consuming, which means that if an open-source alternative already exists, it can be a huge benefit for any individual data scientist. Open-source developers often work on projects to build skills and get community feedback, but there is also prestige inherent in building popular OSS. Often, several different versions of the same algorithm are developed in OSS, with the best code winning out (perhaps due to its speed, versatility, or documentation). In addition to this competitive element, OSS can also be highly collaborative. Since OSS code is all public, it can be cross-examined and interrogated for bugs or possible improvements. With collaborative development and an engaged community, as often arises around popular OSS, this collaborative-competitive environment can frequently result in accessible, robust, and high-quality code.\n",
      "“The work of the average data scientist requires them to be more of a data explorer and programmatic problem solver than a pure mathematician.”\n",
      "This is especially important because many data scientists may not have the mathematical training necessary to implement especially complex algorithms. This is not meant as a criticism of data scientists, but the work of the average data scientist requires them to be more of a data explorer and programmatic problem solver than a pure mathematician. Generally, data scientists are focused on interpreting the results of their data analyses and trying to appropriately fit their algorithms into a digital service or product. This means that well-written open-source AI code significantly expands the capacity of the average data scientist, letting them use more current machine learning algorithms and functionality. Much attention has been paid to training and retaining AI talent, but making AI easier to use, which open-source code does, may have a similarly significant impact in enabling economic growth. Of course, this is undeniably a double-edged sword, as easier to use OSS AI also enables innovation in pernicious applications of AI, including cyberattacks and deepfakes.\n",
      "2. OSS helps reduce AI bias\n",
      "Similarly, open-source AI tools can enable the broader and better use of ethical AI. Open-source tools like OSS like IBM’s AI Fairness 360, Microsoft’s Fairlearn, and the University of Chicago’s Aequitas ease technical barriers to detecting and mitigating AI bias. There are also open-source tools for interpretable and explainable AI, such as IBM’s AI Explainability 360 or Chris Molnar’s interpretable machine learning tool and book, which make it easier for data scientists to interrogate the inner workings of their models. This is critical since data scientists and machine learning engineers at private companies are often time-constrained and operating in competitive markets. In order to keep their jobs, they must work hard on developing models and building products, without necessarily the same pressure on thoroughly examining models for biases. Academic researchers and journalists have done a remarkable job generating broad public awareness of the potential harms of AI bias, and so many data scientists understand these concerns and are personally invested in building ethical AI systems. For those engaged, but busy, data scientists, open-source code can be incredibly helpful in discovering and mitigating discriminatory aspects of machine learning.\n",
      "“Open-source AI tools can enable the broader and better use of ethical AI.”\n",
      "While more government oversight of AI is certainly necessary, policymakers should also more frequently consider investing in OSS for ethical AI as a different lever to improve AI’s role in society. At present, government funding tends to support code development only in the pursuit of academic research. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which funds critical OSS projects, writes that OSS “is crucial to modern scientific research… yet even the most widely-used research software lacks dedicated funding.” This problem is similarly true in the ethical AI space, where government funding exists only for OSS used in early-stage research. For instance, in collaboration with Amazon, the National Science Foundation (NSF) is funding tens of million in grants for further academic research  into AI fairness. This research is very likely to produce highly valuable OSS, but even the most successful projects will be challenged to find continued funding for development, support, documentation, and dissemination. Funders who are interested in ethical AI, including both government agencies and private foundations, should consider OSS as a necessary component of ethical AI, and look to support its sustainable development and widespread adoption.\n",
      "3. OSS AI tools advance science\n",
      "Perhaps even more than technology companies, scientific researchers from many domains gain tremendously from open-source AI. For instance, a series of responses to a tweet by François Chollet, developer of the open-source AI software Keras, demonstrate how his OSS is being used to identify subcomponents of mRNA molecules and build neural interfaces to better help visually impaired people see. The separation of these roles—the developer and the scientist—is common and generally enables both better tools and better science. Most scientific researchers cannot be expected to produce new knowledge within their fields, while also constantly implementing cutting edge statistical tools. Of course, the value of OSS to science has been constant long before the modern re-emergence of machine learning. It is not uncommon for entire community ecosystems of OSS to grow around specific scientific endeavors. Take for instance the OSS project Bioconductor, which, founded In 2001, now contains over two thousand OSS tools for genomic analysis.\n",

      "Yet that scientific OSS is not new should not distract from its incredible value, nor should it mislead one into thinking that the proliferation of OSS AI tools was a certain outcome. In 2007, a group of researchers argued that “the lack of openly available algorithmic implementations is a major obstacle to scientific progress” in a paper entitled “The Need for Open Source Software in Machine Learning.” Certainly, the lack of OSS is not as prevalent of a problem today, although there are still efforts to raise the percent of academic papers which publicly release their code (currently around 50% at the Neural Information Processing Systems conference conference and 70% at International Conference of Machine Learning). Recognizing this value, policymakers should continue to encourage OSS code in the sciences (as through the NSF Fairness in AI program), and certainly avoid inhibiting it, as in the analogous case of the unfortunate consequences of the EU’s data protection law on the sharing of scientific data.\n",
      "OSS software also makes research more reproducible, enabling scientists to check and confirm one another’s results at a time where much of science still faces an ongoing replication crisis. OSS is most directly helpful to reproducible research because the same OSS is available to many different researchers. Without knowing precisely how an experiment or analysis was done, critically evaluating the results of scientific papers can be difficult or impossible. Even small changes in how a mathematical algorithm was implemented can lead to different results—but using the same OSS code can greatly mitigate this source of uncertainty. This general accessibility also means they the commonly used OSS in a field will be better understood within a field, leading to easier interrogation of its use.\n",
      "4. OSS AI helps and hinders technology sector competition\n",
      "OSS has significant ramifications for competition policy, too. At first glance, one might be inclined to think that open-source code enables more market competition, yet this is not clearly the case. On the one hand, the public release of machine learning code broadens and better enables its use. In many industries, this is likely a net boon, and enables more AI adoption with less AI talent, as discussed above. However, OSS AI tools are unlikely to check the growing influence and anti-competitive behavior of the largest technology companies. In terms of their online platforms, it is predominantly the proprietary data and network effects that keep companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon a step above the competition. The ability to use the same algorithms does not really factor into why competing with these large companies is so difficult.\n",
      "In fact, for Google and Facebook, the open sourcing of their deep learning tools (Tensorflow and PyTorch, respectively), may have the exact opposite effect, further entrenching them in their already fortified positions. While OSS is often associated with community involvement and more distributed influence, Google and Facebook appear to be holding on tightly to their software. Despite being open-sourced in 2015, the overwhelming majority of the most prolific Tensorflow contributors are Google employees, and Google pays for administrative staff to run the project. Similarly, almost all of the core developers for PyTorch are Facebook employees. This isn’t surprising, but it is noteworthy. Even in open sourcing them, Google and Facebook are not actually relinquishing any control over the development of these deep learning tools. So, while these tools are certainly more accessible to the public, and their release creates more transparency to their function, the oft stated goal of ‘democratizing’ technology through OSS is, in this case, euphemistic.\n",

      "Conversely, these companies are gaining influence over the AI market through OSS, while the OSS AI tools not backed by companies, such as Caffe and Theano, seem to be losing significance in both AI research and industry. By making their tools the most common in industry and academia, Google and Facebook benefit from the public research conducted with those tools, and, further, they manifest a pipeline of data scientists and machine learning engineers trained in their systems. In a sector with fierce competition for AI talent, Tensorflow and PyTorch also help Google and Facebook bolster their reputation as the leading companies to work on cutting-edge AI problems. Other open-source developers have even added functionality and created more approachable ways to use the AI tools, as is the case through Fast.ai for PyTorch and Keras for Tensorflow. Collectively, these benefits are significant enough that creating leading open-source tools is clearly part of the competitive strategy for these companies—Google and Facebook have also done so in web development, releasing Angular.js and React.js respectively. All told, the benefits to Google and Facebook of dominating OSS deep learning are significant, and this should be accounted for in any discussions of technology sector competition.\n",
      "5. OSS creates default AI standards\n",
      "OSS AI also has important implications for some mainstays of international policy discussions—especially standards bodies. A range of standards bodies, such as IEEE, ISO/JTC, the European Union’s CEN-CENELEC, the U.S.’s NIST, and many others, all seek to influence the rapidly emerging world of AI. Yet, in addition to competing with one another for prominence, these bodies have to navigate a field primarily driven by OSS whose default settings have become the defacto standards.\n",
      "In other industries, standards bodies have sought to disseminate best practices and enable interoperable technology. For much of the machine learning world, this entails trying to encourage consistency and interoperability in a diverse ecosystem of OSS. However, the diversified use of operating systems, programming languages, and specific tools means that AI interoperability challenges have already received substantial attention. This has led to extensive work on technical solutions to interoperability that do not require making consistent coding choices—such as through containerization software and cloud-based microservices. These advances, now well used throughout the industry, make the interoperability appeal of standards less obvious. Further, the data science community is somewhat informal, with many practices and standards disseminated through twitter, blog posts, and OSS documentation. Standards bodies may have to make a significant investment to entice this community into participating in its processes, and so far it is not clear that OSS developers are extensively involved in the ongoing AI standards discussions.\n",
      "“Are we comfortable with an AI world dependent on open source, but entirely corporate controlled, software?”\n",
      "For deep learning specifically, the absence of diversity may also pose a challenge for standards bodies. The apparent dominance of Tensorflow and PyTorch means that Google and Facebook have outsized influence in the development and common use of deep learning methods—one they may be reluctant to cede to consensus driven organizations. Still, the large technology companies, including Google, IBM, and Microsoft, are engaged and exerting influence through the standards bodies, suggesting they believe these standards may come into meaningful effect. It’s unclear how precisely the interaction between OSS and international standards for AI will unfold, but OSS developments and developers will certainly play an important role in the way that AI is used, and they should be more involved in these debates.\n",
      "AI policy is intrinsically tied to OSS\n",
      "From research to ethics, and from competition to innovation, open-source code is playing a central role in the developing use of AI. This makes the consistent absence of open-source developers from policy discussions quite notable, since they wield meaningful influence over, and highly specific knowledge of, the direction of AI. Involving more OSS AI developers can help AI policymakers more routinely consider the influence of OSS on the outcomes we aspire to—the equitable, just, and prosperous use of AI. This may lead to asking different, important questions. Are we comfortable with an AI world dependent on open source, but entirely corporate controlled, software? How can government funding best enable and encourage the beneficial use of AI? What is the right role for standards in a world powered by OSS algorithms? Certainly, the goals and challenges of AI governance are tied to AI’s open-source code. By involving more OSS AI developers, AI policymakers can better consider the influence of OSS in the pursuit of the just and equitable development of AI.\n",

      "The global public health and economic devastation caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak dramatically reinforces the urgent imperative to minimize the chances of another zoonotic pandemic. Reducing the likelihood of another viral spillover sweeping the world requires a fundamental change in how we interact with nature. It requires minimizing human interface with wild animals and wild spaces; eliminating transmission points where the likelihood of viral spillover to humans is high, such as unhygienic commercial markets in wild animal meat and live animals; better monitoring of the legal trade in wildlife; diligently suppressing illegal and unsustainable trade in wildlife; and conserving natural habitats. Conserving natural habitats in turn requires profound changes in human food production and human encroachment on remaining natural habitats. Decisionmaking about pandemic prevention and nature conservation must be elevated to the highest levels of governments on a permanent basis. Such changes will not be easy or cheap, but they are necessary.\n",
      "Reducing the likelihood of another viral spillover sweeping the world requires a fundamental change in how we interact with nature.\n",
      "However, the necessary measures to prevent another pandemic should not entail banning all trade in wildlife. Such a policy would be deeply counterproductive since it would eliminate economic incentives for preserving critical natural ecosystems. Nor should the measures involve eliminating livelihoods of the hundreds of millions of people dependent on hunting for basic food security and subsistence.\n",
      "In order to preserve habitats and wildlife and keep them wild and away from humans to minimize zoogenic viral spillover, global demand for some wildlife products, not just wild meat, but also aspects of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), also needs to be reduced.\n",
      "Adopting such smart, tailored, and essential pandemic prevention measures is crucial for policy effectiveness. Critically, they need to be anchored in fundamental global efforts to save natural habitats and biodiversity.\n",
      "Policies based principally on defensive reactive responses, such as strengthening health care systems or reshaping global production and logistical chains, are inadequate and will be overwhelmed. Yet those have been the bulk of policies around the world so far. With few exceptions, many of the disastrous policies that accelerate the arrival of another zoonotic epidemic or pandemic have accelerated during the COVID-19 period. What is needed is deep prevention based on a fundamental restructuring of how we treat nature, even after COVID-19 vaccines become widely available.\n",

      "Challenge\n",
      "As of January 20, COVID-19 has claimed over two million lives globally and infected almost 96 million people. Twenty years of poverty reduction efforts have been wiped out, with as many as 150 million people pushed into extreme poverty. Since many have been forced to liquidate their human development assets, they and their children may not be able to economically recover for years or decades. Many have been pushed into participation in illegal economies and thrust into the hands of criminal actors and militants. The cumulative devastation surpasses the scale of destruction many a regional war could inflict.\n",
      "Even prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, zoonotic diseases (including HIV/AIDS, Ebola, SARS, flu, yellow fever, and others) caused millions of human deaths and a billion cases of human illness per year.\n",
      "The emergence of other zoonotic diseases and devastating global pandemics is inevitable unless we fundamentally revise our relationship with nature. 75% of emerging diseases are zoonotic, the majority originating in wildlife.\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic exploded in a so-called wet market in Wuhan, China, and entailed the meat of wild animals used for human consumption. Across East and Southeast Asia, open air markets of wild animals often illegally caught are kept in appalling and dangerously unhygienic conditions. Such markets selling wild animal meat and live animals without proper hygienic and veterinary measures pose very high risks of disease emergence and spread. They are present in other parts of the world, including Latin America’s Amazonia region and West and Central Africa. Some sell wild meat for basic subsistence, others are highly commercialized and sell wild animal meat as a luxury. The load of zoonotic viruses intensifies along the trade route from forest or farm to the unhygienic markets. Unlike in East Asia, the consumption of wild animal meat is uncommon in the United States. Nonetheless, bushmeat, sought out by diaspora communities, is smuggled to the U.S.\n",
      "Zoonotic epidemics also emerge due to improper husbandry of domestic or wild animals and other veterinary failures. Such regulatory deficiencies are pervasive around the world and persist also in the United States. The H1N1 swine flu that killed 10,000 Americans emerged in North America as a result of packing thousands of domestic livestock together in a cramped space for food production.\n",
      "Without adequate veterinary practices and pathogen monitoring, the trade in live animals — whether legal or illegal — is yet another spreader of infectious diseases. Between 2012 and 2016, over 11 million live animals representing 1,316 species were exported from 189 countries. China is the largest exporter. The United States is the largest importer of live mammals and amphibians for exotic pets. Yet even with all of the United States’ capacities and border security focus, only a very small fraction of animals legally crossing U.S. borders are inspected for diseases. This lack of health inspection poses grave risks to human health, native biodiversity, and local economies. For example, legally imported frogs carried the devastating chytrid fungus, putting all North American amphibians at risk. Monkeypox which infected people was introduced to the U.S. through such uninspected legal trade. Such dangerous absence of pathogen monitoring of the legal trade in wild animals and their meat, and of seized trafficked animals, is pervasive globally.\n",
      "But it is human encroachment on natural habitats that poses the gravest threat of zoonosis, accounting for 30% of its emergence. As habitat is fragmented or lost, more animals crowd together in constricted spaces where the chance of a viral spillover between species significantly increases. When people and their domesticated animals enter such places —for logging, mining, hunting, food production, or road and residence construction — the odds of transmission to humans increase. Destruction of tropical forests is particularly rife with zoonosis. But zoonotic diseases could also break out in the Arctic and Antarctic regions where global-warming-induced melting of the permafrost can release dangerous pathogens.\n",
      "Back to top ⇑\n",
      "\n",
      "Limits of historic and existing policies\n",
      "Despite the severity of COVID-19 and the urgency of a radically new relationship with nature, smarter legal wildlife trade, and suppression of poaching and wildlife trafficking, most COVID-19 measures globally have centered on mitigation, through vaccine development or economic stimulus packages.\n",
      "China, the world’s largest consumer of wildlife for meat and TCM, has adopted the most significant regulatory change: In response to COVID-19, it declared a ban on consumption of wild meat. China also shut down some wildlife markets and some of its 20,000 wildlife farms, an industry worth some $18 billion annually and employing 6.3 million people. The result is a near comprehensive ban on breeding, selling, and consuming terrestrial wild animals as food. Unlike after SARS, when such similar efforts faded within three years, the existing changes are to be permanent. But they also need to be diligently enforced, often a struggle in China. For example, although the use of pangolin scales is now banned from the official list of TCM ingredients, Chinese TCM companies still market them and China’s national health insurance covers such “medicine.” China also revised its Wildlife Protection Law, which, despite its name, had long enabled commercial trade even in some endangered species.\n",
      "Still, more needs to be done.\n",
      "First, if the ban on unhygienic commercial wildlife and wildlife meat markets remains confined to China, the risks of pathogen transmission will remain high elsewhere in Asia — particularly Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam. If China’s and Southeast Asia’s demand is slashed, buyers of wild animals and their meat will merely outsource pathogen transmission to poorer countries even less prepared for zoonotic outbreaks. Chinese traders can simply arrange the poaching of pangolins in Africa (as is happening already) — not just for scales, but for their meat, and have it frozen. The viral spillover from this most heavily trafficked mammal, a known host to coronaviruses, would then occur among poor hunters abroad while Asian traders and consumers would not see their profits and habits affected.\n",
      "Second, the new Chinese regulations have ambiguities and allow exceptions, such as the farming of wild animals for other commercial purposes like TCM (including the pathogen-rife large-scale production of bat feces to treat eye ailments) and the marketing of products from endangered species (such as products made from leopard bone). Although most TCM does not use wild animal parts, the products that do have dramatically exacerbated the collapse of wild species around the world through legal trade or poaching.\n",
      "Critically, unhygienic practices on TCM wildlife farms produce similar risks of zoonosis,  unless the veterinary and butchering practices are improved. Worse yet, many wildlife farms in China and elsewhere are, in fact, stocked from the wild, introducing pathogens to farms and jeopardizing wild populations.\n",
      "Moreover, China has surrounded these policies with an aggressive promotion of unsubstantiated theories and falsehoods about COVID-19 having emerged outside of China, a narrative that raises questions about China’s determination to reduce the zoonosis-prone practices in China. Beijing also seeks to tightly control a World Health Organization (WHO) investigation into the COVID-19 jump to humans, designating Chinese scientists vulnerable to China’s pressure to lead key parts of the investigation. Nor has China mounted significant pressure on other countries to eliminate their urban wildlife markets.\n",
      "In the United States, a new bill — the Preventing Future Pandemics Act of 2020 — calls for banning the import, export, and sale of live wildlife for human consumption. It would also make it U.S. policy to facilitate international cooperation to support wildlife market closures abroad by reducing demand for wild animal meat, shifting to alternative sources of protein, and improving monitoring of zoonotic diseases.\n",
      "Yet U.S. policy to prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases remains fragmented and inadequate: With few exceptions, there are no U.S. laws specifically requiring disease surveillance for imported wildlife. Few U.S. — or international — agencies focus on zoonosis surveillance. Coordination among them remains insufficient. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention regulates only the importation of wildlife known to present “a significant public health concern,” but does not mandate pro-active pathogen monitoring of other species.\n",
      "The European Union has proposed an international treaty on pandemics. Language circulated so far, and reflected, for example, in the G-20 Riyadh Summit Leaders’ Declaration, calls for both economic and social mitigation measures and prevention measures, including biodiversity conservation.\n",
      "Yet poaching for international supply and bushmeat hunting for subsistence have intensified during 2020. The pandemic has dried up vital ecotourism funding for local communities, rangers, landowners, and protected-area administration, a $29 billion industry employing 3.6 million people in Africa. By July 2020, 90% of African tour operators had experienced a 75% or more decline in bookings, unable to support guards, guides, other employees, and operations. Most national park government agencies in East and Southern Africa are reporting 70 to 90% declines in revenue. Yet in South Africa, 85% of funding for protected areas comes from ecotourism and trophy hunting, mostly from foreign tourists. The presence of tourists and guides also helps surveillance and deterrence against poaching. Pressures to convert land from native habitats to agriculture are also rising.\n",
      "Elsewhere, ecotourism has never brought sustained and sufficient funding to make biodiversity preservation viable, and many protected areas critically lack funding, and exist as “paper parks,” even as Africa’s population continues to expand and pressures on native habitats rise dramatically. The situation is similarly dire in many protected areas in Latin America and Asia.\n",
      "Deforestation in tropical forests that are most valuable for zoonosis prevention, biodiversity preservation, and carbon sequestration has also dramatically accelerated during 2020. Budget-starved governments are susceptible to entreaties by powerful extractive industries promising rapid revenues from logging, mining, and agricultural production. Unemployed people have been desperately seeking jobs in illegal logging, mining, and poaching, especially as COVID-19 has produced reverse migration from urban spaces to rural ones for the first time in decades.\n",
      "In Brazil, deforestation of the Amazon shot up to a 12-year high, with 4,281 square miles of rainforest destroyed from August 2019 to July 2020. Over 2,500 fires have raged there this year, indicative of land grabbers converting forests to pasture and croplands. Some burned deep inside the rainforest, advancing the Amazon’s irreversible tipping point of collapse. President Jair Bolsonaro’s policies to dismantle protections and enforcement have not changed significantly, even though a pandemic could easily emerge from Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America.\n",
      "Even though in September 2020 the Green Climate Fund questionably awarded Indonesia a $103.8 billion payment for preventing deforestation and carbon release between 2014 and 2016, intense deforestation and fires took place then, and persist now. In the first weeks of 2020, forest loss in Indonesia rose by 50%. The deforestation fires pollute air with dangerous PM2.5 particles, further weakening human (and animal) respiratory systems and augmenting COVID-19 death rates. Worse yet, in September 2020, the Indonesian government introduced a bill to significantly weaken environmental regulations.\n",
      "This immediate pandemic-producing environmental destruction is taking place as our planet is experiencing alarming levels of species loss. The rate of species extinction is now as much as 1,000 times the historical average, the worst since the dinosaurs died.\n",
      "Back to top ⇑\n",
      "\n",
      "Policy recommendations\n",
      "Dealing with pandemics cannot rest merely on mitigation. It must focus on deep prevention and synchronization with other policy objectives such as halting global warming. It must address all sources and vectors of zoonoses: legal trade in wildlife, poaching and wildlife trafficking, and habitat destruction.\n",
      "Many of the action-points proposed below are resource-intensive. Implementing some will require international assistance to poor countries lacking capacities for implementation. Some will be politically unpopular: Both legal extractive industries and illegal economies often powerful lobbies to prevent, hijack, and subvert regulatory agendas. Poor regulation and illicit economies thrive in the context of corruption, particularly when it pervades the highest levels of governments. Prevailing over vested interests and corruption requires sustained domestic and international pressure. But at stake are tens of millions of lives and tens of trillions of dollars that no government should want to lose.\n",
      "Implementation of the steps below will not take place overnight. It will be a gradual process of policies being changed, regulatory and enforcement systems being strengthened, and habits and practices being altered. Nonetheless, even a gradual adoption that does not achieve full compliance would reduce the speed and frequency with which zoonotic diseases emerge and flare up into pandemics.\n",
      "Phasing out unhygienic markets in wild animal meat and live animals\n",
      "Phasing out unhygienic urban markets in wild meat and live animals is imperative. In places where they are not the source of basic subsistence and protein access, such as in large parts of Southeast Asia, bans should be adopted. Such bans need to be diligently enforced even though it will affect the livelihoods of traders. Poor traders should be compensated for their losses.\n",
      "When governments give permission to sell sale animals in stores or other venues, the licensing and inspection processes need to ensure that proper care and hygienic conditions are maintained. Violators need to have their licenses removed and face meaningful prosecution.\n",
      "Wet markets in China and Asia should not be banned. Most do not sell meat from terrestrial wild animals. They provide access to food for many people in Asia, sometimes as much as 30-40% of the population. However, like in wildlife-sale venues, diligent monitoring and enforcement need to be implemented, such as through the use of CCTV cameras.\n",

      "Where wildlife meat markets serve as sources of basic subsistence, such as in West and Central Africa, they cannot merely be banned. Hundreds of millions of people around the world depend on hunting for protein access. A ban on wild meat should not undermine their food security. Phasing them out will take time and needs to be accompanied by working with local communities, understanding drivers of wild meat consumption, overcoming obstacles to the development of alternative sources of protein development and consumption, and developing other sources of income.\n",
      "Such efforts will also require changing preferences in taste and habits of wild meat consumption. The consequences of zoonotic pandemics in terms of global deaths and poverty, which ultimately hurt local subsistence communities, are too large to merely accept that people have a cultural preference for wild meat. Just as affluent consumers in Asia need to accept changes for global public safety, so do people in Africa, though no one can be left to starve. (People may have a taste for driving fast, yet the world has adopted speeding regulations). Moreover, bushmeat hunting is often not sustainable and contributes to biodiversity losses and food and economic insecurity, such as in Ghana.\n",
      "Where alternative protein sources cannot be developed, and even where they can, resources for pathogen testing in meat (also fruit, a link in the Ebola outbreaks) need to be made available to local communities. International assistance should also focus on bringing refrigeration, health inspections, and hygienic slaughtering practices to local communities. Efforts to wean marginalized poor communities off wild meat need to be accompanied by broader development efforts, including health and schooling, and the delivery of environmentally-sustainable economic opportunities.\n",
      "Enforcement of bans \n",
      "Diligent efforts are required to enforce such bans, anticipating that they will push trade in wild animals and meat underground or online. Illegal warehouses of wild animals and meat can be dangerous sources of zoonoses and must be shut down, their operators prosecuted. Enforcement poses challenges, as smuggling networks will seek new routes and markets, as happened after the EU’s ban on wild bird imports after the avian influenza outbreak. Law enforcement forces can respond by mounting extensive undercover operators online and on the ground.\n",
      "Not all illegal markets are equally dangerous: Any time significant barriers to entry are put up for a market, such as through bans and enforcement, demand goes down — as some buyers will not invest in seeking out hidden online platforms or locating an underground market, and risking penalties. No doubt there are risks that even smaller illegal markets will be a source of transmission if pathogen monitoring is not possible.\n",
      "It is imperative to achieve substantial effective identification and prosecution of violators to create deterrence effects against clandestine offenses. Such a robust prosecution rate requires resources for what are not current law enforcement priorities and capacities. Equally needed is testing for all seized meat and animals for pathogens, and their safe handling.\n",
      "But if a ban pushes a market underground without any enforcement and pathogen monitoring, and demand has not gone significantly down, as would likely happen in wild meat subsistence markets, the policy outcome can be worse than the original problem. Sequencing, preparation, and local tailoring matter.\n",
      "Reducing demand for wild animals and products that threaten health and biodiversity\n",
      "Multifaceted efforts need to be launched to reduce demand for wild meat as a luxury enjoyed among the rising middle classes and the affluent in Peru, Brazil, and West Africa, just as demand needs to be reduced in East Asia where traders may be tempted to supply the demand with animals from abroad in the wake of China’s ban. Instead of famous Latin American chefs luring people into eating caiman and anaconda and creating new demand for wildlife, what should be promoted as cool is eating in ways that preserve biodiversity and prevent pandemics.\n",
      "It is also imperative to suppress demand and supply of wildlife products that lead to major ecological losses, such as TCM products sourced with unsustainable offtake and poaching. Often without any scientific proof, traders promote the consumption of animals or plants to cure all kinds of diseases and to enhance longevity and sexual potency. TCM products should no longer be derived from threatened or endangered wildlife. Their commercialization as symbols of status and luxury has been driving tigers, rhinoceroses, hornbills, and other species to extinction.\n",
      "Effectively regulating and curbing the excesses and dangers of the TCM industry and wildlife traders in East Asia will be especially challenging, as China’s TCM industry is politically powerful, generating large revenues for the government and jobs for many. During and after the SARS epidemic, the industry pushed TCM as cures. It has orchestrated the imprisonment of Chinese doctors who warn against TCM health risks. For years, the government has strongly embraced the TCM industry and worked to advance its interests abroad. In 2019, China succeeded in cajoling the WHO into including a chapter on TCM in its International Classification of Diseases, a highly influential document that categorizes and assigns codes to medical conditions, and is used internationally to decide how doctors diagnose conditions and whether insurance companies will pay to treat them. The Chinese government promoted — without proof — the use of TCM to cure COVID-19 and encouraging the export of unproven TCM products as COVID-19 medications to highly vulnerable countries with inadequate health systems such as Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n",
      "Just as Asia and Africa need to get away from a taste for dangerous wild meat and TCM, the United States must also reduce demand for wildlife — for wild meat among diaspora communities and others and for exotic pets that carry pathogens or pose other severe environmental threats (for example, the destruction of the Everglades by pythons pet owners released into the wild.) Importation of invasive species for commercial purposes should be banned.\n",
      "Beyond bans, imposing heavy taxes on the dangerous aspects of the legal trade in wildlife is one important mechanism to reduce demand and supply. If reduced demand for exotic pets or animal products reduces economic opportunities for marginalized populations, such as in Africa where wildlife farming and exports can be significant sources of GDP and employment, collaborative efforts should be mounted to develop legal economic opportunities that do not threaten biodiversity and payment systems for biodiversity preservation.\n",
      "Smarter, tighter, healthier legal trade\n",
      "Exotic pets or wildlife products that are allowed — in the U.S and around the world —need be subjected to diligent monitoring for disease, whether the animals were bred on farms or sustainably sourced from the wild.\n",
      "That requires significantly increasing resources to monitor pathogens and inspect traded animals and wildlife products. International cooperation and assistance, including resource transfers to poor countries, are needed to robustly mount such inspections along entire trade routes from source to destination, such as through programs like the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded PREDICT project that found more than 900 novel viruses in wildlife trafficked across 25 countries.\n",
      "Where adequate monitoring is available, but future zoonotic outbreaks are purposefully hidden, prosecutions for criminal negligence, financial penalties, and international sanctions for the lack of disclosure may be considered. This is all the more important because even though prevention must be the key centerpiece of policy, zoonoses will continue to arise and their spread will need to be halted as soon as possible.\n",
      "Beyond increasing monitoring resources, the United States can legislate new regulatory frameworks to mandate health inspections of legal wildlife trade and domestic wildlife farms, assign responsibility for monitoring, and improve agency coordination. It can also require that only animals certified as healthy at the point of origin and again at entry to the U.S. may be imported. Retaining access to the U.S. market would be a big motivator for other countries to adopt similar regulations and perhaps even allow U.S. veterinary inspectors to be placed in their countries to monitor and certify to health of animals being exported. Similar certificates should also be mandated for U.S. wildlife exports.\n",
      "But not all trade in wildlife should be banned. Such a blanket prohibition would critically undermine conservation and increase the chance of another pandemic. Trophy hunting and wildlife products of various animal parts, such as skins, furs, souvenirs, and curios pose low to no risks of a pandemic — if farming and butchering are carried out with proper veterinary and hygienic standards.\n",
      "If offtake from the wild is well-regulated to preserve sustainability and is devoid of corruption — no doubt, major challenges — it augments conservation by giving landowners and local communities powerful economic stakes in preserving natural habitats and wildlife and allowing converted landscapes to revert back to their more natural state, thus resurrecting ecosystems.\n",
      "In the absence of economic benefits to be gained from biodiversity preservation, such as from trophy hunting, both governmental and private landowners starved of revenues will be even susceptible to powerful economic pressures to deforest land for timber and agricultural production, such as in soy, African oil palm, or cattle. Poaching would rise further.\n",
      "If accompanied by safe health standards, wildlife ranching should be particularly promoted where it helps preserve native ecosystems.\n",
      "Indeed, the consumption of hygienically-butchered and inspected wild meat may enhance conservation by improving habitat quality by a) reducing overpopulated species (such as deer in the U.S., wild boar in Europe, and buffalo in Africa); b) removing invasive species (through the creation of new food markets, such as for pythons in the Everglades or destructive invasive lionfish in the Atlantic); c) preserving quality habitats through the consumption of non-endangered species (such as antelope in Africa); or d) enabling restoration of a species in the wild and native habitats (such as from bison husbandry in the U.S.).\n",
      "Such consumption should be allowed and encouraged if the species is not endangered or threatened — nor carries dangerous pathogens — and its slaughtering is conducted according to strict hygienic rules that minimize the chance of zoonotic transmission. Hunting for personal subsistence should not be prohibited in forest-dependent communities or developed countries, though the meat should be tested for pathogens.\n",
      "In contrast, commercial wildlife farms that exacerbate the decline of wild populations or fail to halt it, and that rely on stocking from the wild or laundering poached animals, such as commercial farms in tigers, should be shut down. So should farms that fail veterinary inspections which need to be frequent. Providing compensation for shutdowns may be appropriate, particularly for poor farmers.\n",
      "Intensifying efforts against poaching and wildlife trafficking\n",
      "Suppressing poaching and trafficking around the world must include shutting down retail markets selling animals illegally, focusing on the apprehension of the crucial middle operational layer of trafficking networks, and enhancing in situ law enforcement. To create deterrence effects requires sufficient frequency of prosecution. High but rare penalties neither deter nor incapacitate criminal networks. Effective in situ law enforcement in turn requires assisting marginalized communities with the development of human capital, social mobility, and sustainable legal incomes, whether in ecotourism or completely unrelated fields. In some cases, where legal alternatives cannot be generated, donors may have to pay for not poaching — with diligent monitoring and conditionality (an effort analogous to creating economic markets and systems for payments for ecosystem services).\n",
      "Indeed, funding conservation must move toward diversified funding beyond ecotourism, such as by pricing biodiversity.\n",
      "Preserving native habitats\n",
      "Last, but not least, we must tackle the greatest source of zoonotic disease emergence: the catastrophic and increasing destruction of global habitats. Prioritizing the preservation of tropical forests and other habitats must be at the top of the agenda.\n",
      "That requires profoundly changing food production and other agricultural practices that lead to deforestation, such as industrial cultivation of African oil palm and soybean. Such changes also include reducing consumption of red meat, particularly beef, reducing the amount of hectares required to rear a cow and other livestock, while maintaining sound veterinary practices, and reducing the use of antibiotics, water, and overall footprint of food production.\n",
      "Efforts to reduce global warming must be synchronized with preserving biodiversity and habitats, so that biofuel cultivation does not produce deforestation and land conversion from natural habitats.\n",
      "The needed policies include local-context tailored mixes of bans of deforestation and differentiated taxation. Heavy taxes should be imposed on any permitted new deforestation from quality habitats and tax breaks given for use of land of already low biodiversity value. Firm baseline cutoffs of what land is considered degraded should be set in months before new regulations are announced to avoid rushes to deforest. Collaborating with biologists and zoonotic experts to determine which areas are less sensitive is important.\n",
      "Efforts to induce consumers to buy only environmentally sustainable goods need to move beyond Western countries to China, India, Brazil, and elsewhere, difficult as that is, but must be accompanied with far greater reliability of certification that avoids “greenwashing,” by independent globally-funded monitors with unfettered access, and financial accessibility of sustainable products, such as through tax breaks. Employing U.S. laws to prosecute extractive firms engaged in pandemic-prone deforestation abroad could provide a powerful tool.\n",
      "Crucially, biodiversity conservation requires pricing biodiversity. Such payment systems entail augmenting financial transfers from developed to developing countries for habitat preservation — in essence, government, industries, and businesses buying themselves pandemic prevention by preserving the planet’s habitats. Because of the economic costs of pandemics, industries and businesses too profit from prevention through biodiversity conversation and thus have economic motives in absorbing such payments, even if regulation is needed to prompt them.\n",
      "One component of biodiversity pricing is readily available — forgiving debt to developing countries in exchange for habitat conservation and phasing out dangerous aspect of wildlife trade. Such debt forgiveness needs to be sequenced for many years, and conditioned on diligent monitoring, with suspension of the debt forgiveness if deforestation resumes — so that governments don’t pocket the money while deforestation is only delayed. To avoid such outcomes, where several years of success are wiped out in one subsequent year, like in Brazil, coalitions of private-public partnerships for preserving the local forest need to be built to neutralize the power of vested interests.\n",
      "Since private financial institutions and the Chinese government hold much of Africa’s foreign debt, engaging China on debt forgiveness in exchange of biodiversity conservation is critical — and not easy. China has long been satisfied with improving its destroyed environment while outsourcing environmental destruction for timber, minerals, and wildlife abroad. Getting private lenders to agree to nature-for-debt swaps will also take creativity in public-private partnership and multilayered financial transfers.\n",
      "Creating other payments for ecosystem services (PES) is much harder. PES systems by forest preservation must not merely compensate carbon capture, but instead center on maximization of biodiversity and native habitats. Native tropical forests should receive far greater payments for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) than forest plantations. President Joe Biden’s proposal to create a $20 billion world fund for the Amazon is a start. But any funding must be dispersed gradually, and suspended if deforestation does not slow and is not maintained.\n",
      "Various schemes to create financial compensation for ecosystem protection and maintenance exist in the U.S., Gabon, China, Mexico, Costa Rica, Germany, and elsewhere. But they remain small, unreliable, clumsy, complicated, and vastly insufficient. Many improvements are needed; importantly, for a robust takeoff of sufficient demand for PES, government regulations and mandates will be necessary. The PES potential may be there, but the infrastructure and regulatory impetus are still lacking.\n",
      "Moving toward such an environmentally-sustainable world is not cheap: Some studies put the cost of financing to avoid further environmental degradation at $20-$45 billion annually, others at $60 billion, others yet at hundreds of billions. But generating such money is not impossible. After all, the U.S. has been willing to spend more annually on the deployment of troops to Afghanistan despite no victory in sight, even though terrorism kills only a small fraction of the number of people killed by COVID-19. And the economic cost of COVID-19 has been over $10 trillion in less than a year. At stake are millions of lives, trillions in economic costs, and food security.\n",

      "Conclusion\n",
      "There are enormous risks that as COVID-19 vaccines become available and memories of the crisis wane, a determination to prevent pandemics by preserving biodiversity will also wane. Vested interests will push for looser regulations that further undermine global ecosystems and increase the dangerous aspects of wildlife trade. Enforcement of regulations may weaken.\n",
      "To avoid such tendencies requires permanently elevating pandemic prevention via biodiversity conservation and smart wildlife trade regulation to the highest levels of national security. In the U.S., this should be through a body spanning the National Security Council (the NSC) and the Domestic Policy Council (DPC) that could direct and synchronize policies at home and abroad. The NSC and DPC are not the only U.S. policy and regulatory bodies to deal with preventing outbreaks and spread of zoonotic disease. Some of the other key institutions include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Departments of Agriculture, Interior, Justice, Commerce, and State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The role of DPC and NSC is to ensure that each department elevate the necessary policies to mitigate zoonotic disease emergence and spread to the top of their agendas and coordinate the efforts.\n",
      "At the international level, a better institutional framework is badly needed to address the massive regulatory hole. The existing system is not only fragmented but also weakened, underequipped, and underfocused on zoonotic pandemics challenges and their prevention. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates the legal trade in wildlife but does not deal with zoonotic disease emergence. The WHO focuses on mitigating the public health consequences of zoonotic diseases but not the prevention of their outbreaks. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crimes supports analyses of illicit economies in natural resources and provides training to mitigate them, and INTERPOL has increasingly undertaken investigations of environmental crimes, while the U.N. Environment Programme helps disseminate knowledge of better environmental practices. But their role and focus in preventing zoonotic outbreaks has been weak. Critical for better policy implementation are also regional bodies, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which has been discussing and promoting tighter own veterinary and environmental regulations since the SARS outbreak. But ASEAN-endorsed practices and policies on wildlife trade and farming remain weak and inadequate. Moreover, international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as private financial actors are crucial for developing financing mechanisms for biodiversity conservation and thus also critical for the conversation.\n",
      "Severe threats to human health are often the best motivators for environmental regulations (for example, regulations that emerged in response to health damage of acid rain and ozone depletion, or mercury-content related temporary reductions in shark fin soup consumption).\n",
      "COVID-19 provides a tragic but important opportunity to reduce global demand for the consumptive use of animals which has spread dangerous pathogens and produced unsustainable exploitation and extinction, and to fundamentally reorient global economies toward environmental sustainability.\n",
      "How fast the next zoonotic pandemic emerges will be determined not only by sound regulations that avoid both policy underreach and overreach and their diligent enforcement, but also, crucially, by continual reminders to the world’s decisionmakers and publics of the immense stakes.\n",
      "How fast the next zoonotic pandemic emerges will be determined not only by sound regulations that avoid both policy underreach and overreach and their diligent enforcement, but also, crucially, by continual reminders to the world’s decisionmakers and publics of the immense stakes.\n",
      "We live — or perish — in a world where the health of the planet and its ecosystems and non-human creatures is fundamentally linked to our survival — including, as COVID-19 shows, very immediately.\n",

      "TITLE: \n",
      "According to President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), approximately 3.1 million jobs will be rendered obsolete or permanently altered as a consequence of artificial intelligence technologies. Artificial intelligence (AI) will, for the foreseeable future, have a significant disruptive impact on jobs. That said, this disruption can create new opportunities if policymakers choose to harness them—including some with the potential to help address long-standing social inequities. Investing in quality training programs that deliver premium skills, such as computational analysis and cognitive thinking, provides a real opportunity to leverage AI’s disruptive power.\n",

      "AI’s disruption presents a clear challenge: competition to traditional skilled workers arising from the cross-relevance of data scientists and code engineers, who can adapt quickly to new contexts. Data analytics has become an indispensable feature of successful companies across all industries. This reality dictates that companies invest heavily in data analytics to remain competitive and profitable. Consequently, unlikely industries such as retail, banking, finance, and even agricultural firms are aggressively competing for talent with specific computational data science and programming skills. A recent IBM report expertly quantifies the scope and breadth of employers’ hiring demands, noting that “[d]emand for data-driven decision makers, such as data-enabled marketing managers, will comprise one-third of the data savvy professional job market, with a projected increase of 110,000 positions by 2020.” Herein lies a window of opportunity: the rapidly growing technical skills gap.\n",
      "Investing in high-quality education and training programs is one way that policymakers proactively attempt to address the workforce challenges presented by artificial intelligence. It is essential that we make affirmative, inclusive choices to ensure that marginalized communities participate equitably in these opportunities.\n",
      "Policymakers should prioritize understanding the demographics of those most likely to lose jobs in the short-run. As opposed to obsessively assembling case studies, we need to proactively identify policy entrepreneurs who can conceive of training policies that equip workers with technical skills of “long-game” relevance. As IBM points out, “[d]ata democratization impacts every career path, so academia must strive to make data literacy an option, if not a requirement, for every student in any field of study.”\n",
      "Machines are an equal opportunity displacer, blind to color and socioeconomic status.\n",
      "Machines are an equal opportunity displacer, blind to color and socioeconomic status. Effective policy responses require collaborative data collection and coordination among key stakeholders—policymakers, employers, and educational institutions—to  identify at-risk worker groups and to inform workforce development strategies. Machine substitution is purely an efficiency game in which workers overwhelmingly lose. Nevertheless, we can blunt these effects by identifying critical leverage points.\n",
      "Investing in innovative education and training is an excellent place to start. Bill Gates’ recent $1.7 billion investment in U.S. public schools is a sign of the way forward, which offers two compelling messages for policymakers. First, innovate and experiment until we identify the right policies. Second, prioritize high-needs schools in poor neighborhoods; they deserve distinct attention to close their opportunity gaps and prepare them to be competitive in the future workforce.\n",
      "Policymakers can choose to harness AI’s disruptive power to address workforce challenges and redesign fair access to opportunity simultaneously. We should train our collective energies on identifying practical policies that update our current agrarian-based education model, which unfairly disadvantages children from economically segregated neighborhoods. Evidence from a Harvard and New York University research study suggests attending a high-quality high school increases a student’s chances of attending a four-year college; which by extension improves their future income earning potential.\n",
      "Let me ask a bold question: how much do we lose if we experiment with substituting an entry-level data science class for machine shop or a vocational carpentry program in urban high schools and community colleges? A 2010 pilot partnership between the University of California, Los Angeles and the National Science Foundation is an encouraging sign; the pilot focuses on redesigning computer science curricula in urban high schools to include newer mobile technologies and computational analysis.\n",

Google’s TensorFlow is an open source machine-learning platform; its free price tag makes the platform an accessible and scalable training resource for schools with constrained budgets.

An applied data science program teaching gateway coding skills such as Python, R, SQL, and computational analysis would boost employment possibilities and create meaningful pathways to economic mobility.\n",

      "Although the population has been rising, the number of births in the U.S. the past few years has been below the peak baby-boom levels, possibly because many couples chose not to have children during bad economic times.

      "So what do these demographic facts portend for the federal budget?  In simple dollars and cents, the federal government spends more on the old than the young. More older Americans means more federal spending on Social Security and Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly. On top of that, health care spending per person is likely to continue to grow faster than the overall economy.\n",
      "The net result: 85 percent of the increase in federal spending that the Congressional Budget Office projects for the next 10 years, based on current policies, will go toward Social Security, Medicare and other major federal health programs, and interest on the national debt.\n",

      "Between the COVID-19 pandemic and the tragic death of George Floyd, the country’s ongoing crisis of racism has come into stark relief. Black Americans are disproportionately diagnosed with or dying from COVID-19 due to structural conditions, while also facing major economic risks as the racial unemployment gap between white and Black populations is the widest it’s been in five years. At the same time, Black people are still vulnerable to police violence that too often occurs without consequences. While there is a great deal of work to be done to dismantle structural racism, it is imperative to use this moment to remove racial barriers and invest in long-term prosperity for Black people, enterprises, and communities.\n",

      "Closing the racial wealth divide can create better health, educational, and economic outcomes for Black Americans. The tech industry, which has both a significant need for more racial equity and a plethora of jobs that don’t require an expensive college degree, can offer pathways to higher incomes and opportunities for wealth creation. Rodney Sampson recognized this when he co-founded Opportunity Hub (OHUB), a technology, startup, and venture ecosystem-building platform created to ensure that everyone, everywhere has equitable access to the future of work and the fourth industrial revolution as a path to multigenerational wealth creation with no reliance on preexisting wealth. Leveraging its metrics-driven blueprint and methodology—as outlined in “Building Inclusive Entrepreneurship Ecosystems In Communities of Color” with the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City—OHUB delivers early exposure, skills development, talent placement, entrepreneurship-support programming, and market and capital access. This is driven by racial equity as well as diversity, equity, and inclusion solutions; innovation labs and equity districts; college campus programs; skills and training programs; talent placement efforts; entrepreneurial support and startup acceleration; and capital formation.\n",
      "Execution \n",
      "In 2013, Rodney Sampson and his wife, Shanterria Sampson, co-founded Opportunity Hub after the release of Sampson’s fourth book, Kingonomics: Twelve Innovative Currencies for Transforming Your Business and Life Inspired by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The book asserts that equitable access to the innovation economy creates systemic change, economic justice, and an accelerated path out of poverty and income inequality.\n",
      "After hearing the needs of thousands of aspiring Black tech startup founders at the Kingonomics’ large-scale innovation, entrepreneurship, and investment conferences hosted by Sampson and ABC’s Shark Tank, OHUB launched in Atlanta and quickly became the largest Black-owned multicampus coworking entrepreneurship center and technology hub in the United States. It is definitively focused on diversity, inclusion, and equity as a business and investment thesis for the development of high-demand technical talent, net new permanent jobs, and high-growth company-building. Each year, thousands of people learn, engage, build, and work via the OHUB ecosystem.\n",
      "OHUB’s blueprint for building ground-up, hyperlocal, globally connected, diverse, equitable, and inclusive technology, startup, and venture ecosystems is represented by the Economic Development Pyramid below and executed across its wholly owned subsidiaries and sister organizations. \n",
      "\n",
      "OHUB executes these economic development efforts with diversity, equity, and inclusion solutions, innovation labs and equity districts, college campus programs, skills and training programs, talent placement efforts, entrepreneurial support and startup acceleration, and capital formation.\n",
      "Racial equity and DEIS (diversity, equity, and inclusion solutions)\n",
      "Creating racial equity throughout the technology, startup, and venture ecosystem to create shared prosperity, economic mobility, and new multigenerational wealth for everyone is foundational and core to OHUB’s definitive purpose and mission. To execute, OHUB partners with leading organizations, influencers, platforms, and enterprises to aggregate industry- or ecosystem-wide racial equity pledges to implement DEIS value-added services, strategy, and solutions across an organization’s corporate governance, human resources, procurement, product development (corporate innovation), go-to-market, impact, and investment. Existing partners include the Brookings Institution, VentureBeat, and Brad Feld. Annual fees include the fair market value of a full-time chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer’s salary and the costs associated with any initiatives created as a result of the DEIS process.\n",

In September 2014, they added 14,000 square feet, with an expansion to West Midtown’s Giant Lofts and the historic Westside in a joint venture with the late Herman J. Russell. In late 2015, OHUB joined forces with local entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to open a 25,000-square-foot campus in Georgia Tech’s Technology Square. This partnership has invested in over 40 high-growth tech startups that have raised more than $400 million in follow on capital, are valued at $1.5 billion, and employ more than 2,000 people. Today, OHUB operates an ecosystem-building lab in the historic 18th & Vine District in Kansas City, Mo. and an innovation lab with the Morehouse Innovation & Entrepreneurship Center in Atlanta.\n",
      "In June 2020, OHUB formed OHUB Development as a wholly owned subsidiary to joint venture with real estate developers via public-private partnerships to build “equity districts” as mixed-use residential, commercial, and retail community concepts that will house OHUB’s early exposure, immersive learning, startup support, and investing programs in socially disadvantaged communities and/or Opportunity Zones in key U.S. cities. OHUB joins as a co-developer and investor, also leveraging a small monthly fee per square foot to fund the programs and innovation spaces and labs.\n",

The median pay for summer internships was $20,000. The median starting salary for our full-time hires was $97,500. This yielded a growing economic impact of approximately $8,375,000 annually.\n",
      "In 2020, OHUB was preparing to bring 500 students to the fifth annual OHUB.SXSW. Due to COVID-19, however, the in-person experience was canceled and rescheduled as a virtual experience a week later, with over 1,100 students, young professionals, and entrepreneurs. For participating students, all travel, hotel, meals, conference registration was paid. Student OHUB members apply to be selected. The opportunity is supported by corporations, venture-backed startups, and foundations, including Deloitte, NBCUniversal, Accenture, Facebook, Google, KC Global Design, and the Kauffman Foundation.

      "Since 2014, OHUB has been collaborating on immersive technology bootcamps for adult learners, recent college graduates, and youth to become proficient and employable as entry-level software developers. In 2015, OHUB launched the nation’s first software engineering and entrepreneurship workforce development program in partnership with leading coding schools and entrepreneurship support programs. This program became the model and framework for our nation’s TechHire initiative under the Obama White House and a national scholarship fund that trained over 300 undertapped Americans from low-income and socially disadvantaged communities to code in in-demand programming languages. They were subsequently placed in paid internships, apprenticeships, or full-time roles as entry-level software developers creating an economic output of over $15 million annually and growing.\n",
      "Today, through an effort called OHUB Futures under the leadership of Heather Hiles, OHUB is expanding its immersive training offerings nationwide and beyond via partnerships with employers, foundations, online training bootcamps, colleges and universities, and industry associations.\n",
      "Leif has joined forces with OHUB Futures to launch the first racial-equity-focused income share agreement (ISA) financing vehicle. The financing vehicle will provide funding to launch technology careers for thousands of Black Americans. The initial financing, targeting $50 million, endeavors to finance the education of 10,000 students per year on a recurring basis by leveraging the pay-it-forward philosophy of ISAs.\n",

      "Capital formation\n",
      "In 2019, 100 Black Angels & Allies Fund I was formed to institutionalize the thesis of investing in Black founders, accelerators, and funds. Its mission is to align smart, innovative, and skilled Black and ally capital to build a scalable and sustainable Black technology, startup entrepreneurship, and venture ecosystem. The fund is investing $1.5 million in venture funds managed by Black general partners that have a track record of increased performance, yet still experience implicit bias. These investments provide investors who have limited capital access with venture funds with larger minimums and pro-rata access to later-stage high-growth companies with the objective of further de-risking the principal investment. The fund also invested $1 million for a 7.5% stake in OHUB and $2 million in high-growth startup companies curated from the OHUB ecosystem. Limited partners invest a minimum of $50,000 to $5,000,000 in the fund.\n",
      "Cost and timeframe \n",
      "Funding and time frame of execution varies by program, service, or wholly owned subsidiary. These factors are noted under the program descriptions above.\n",
      "For the second half of 2020, OHUB is working toward raising $10 to $12 million to scale their work across all of their subsidiaries and programs to meet the current moment of COVID-19, the response to the ongoing racial injustice, and the realities that the national workforce faces. By 2021, OHUB plans to train 1,000 people at a cost of $15 million, pre-accelerate 500 high-growth firms at a cost of $2.5 million, accelerate 100 firms at a cost of $5 million, and invest in the seed rounds of 10 companies at $5 million.\n",
      "Key components and features \n",
      "For enterprises, OHUB is a supplier and partner of its diversity, equity, and inclusion Solutions (DEIS) to over 50 tech companies, major corporations, high-growth startups, and venture funds.\n",
      "For undertapped and socially disadvantaged communities, OHUB provides a membership model that provides access to curated content, programs, and resources designed to expose and connect aspiring technologists, professionals, innovators, entrepreneurs, and a new class of investors to opportunities in the fourth industrial revolution.\n",
      "For adult learners looking to reskill and upskill, OHUB provides immersive certificates in technical (coding, cybersecurity, distributed ledger) and nontechnical (sales, marketing, business) skills and helps them build their startup and access capital.\n",
      "For colleges and universities, with a special focus on HBCUs and minority-serving institutions (MSIs), OHUB delivers end-to-end technology, startup and venture ecosystem-building programs, initiatives, and revenue streams.\n",
      "For municipalities, as noted above, OHUB builds equity districts to create and sustain inclusive in-demand workforces and entrepreneurial ecosystems in the form of public-private partnerships to disrupt income inequality, poverty, and the racial wealth gap while increasing a region’s economic mobility and growth for all of its constituents.\n",
      "Successes\n",
      "With its extensive and growing repertoire of programs, the Opportunity Hub is taking an innovative approach to close three major gaps: the racial representation gap in tech, funding and market gaps, and the racial wealth gap. OHUB has already begun the equity work that must be continued and duplicated in other U.S. cities to recover from the consequences of COVID-19. Taking steps to ensure that Black people don’t continue to feel the dire economic effects of structural racism will better position the country in COVID-19 recovery and beyond. \n",
      "Considerations\n",
      "During the COVID-19 crisis and following the death of George Floyd, OHUB has seen a heightened increase in the demand of their work and services as a platform that centers racial equity, talent development, and access to capital. While funding from economic development organizations and foundations had been nascent, the sudden spike in the nation’s interest to dismantle white supremacy and achieve racial equity is a positive sign that this support will grow in even more places.\n",
      "Regarding their work, OHUB’s proximity to tech has allowed them to make the shift to virtual programming quite well. OHUB.365 is a new series that was born out of the COVID-19 era to provide daily content to continue their early exposure efforts. The in-person OHUB.SXSW conference was replaced with a virtual experience for participating students. Momentum@Morehouse launched in May 2020 as an effort to reskill workers who were displaced by COVID-19.\n",
      "In doing their work, the lessons that OHUB has learned are captured in this transparent statement by Rodney Sampson: “If we were non-Black doing this, we’d have raised billions by now and would have changed thousands of Black lives and communities. The difficult we do immediately. The impossible takes yet a second longer.” \n",

      "Software application developers earn large salaries in the United States, $96,260 a year on average. But in metropolitan San Jose they earn $131,270, the highest in the country. There are many partial explanations for this—local cost of living, differences in education levels, experience, and industry—but none of them quite account for it. It turns out that developers living in San Jose have acquired the specific skills most valued by employers.\n",
      " \n",
      "As the map below shows, there is a huge amount of variation in earnings for software application developers across regional labor markets. In large metropolitan areas like New York, they earn $105,000, but in Louisville, they earn just $72,000.\n",

      "The surprising thing, when it comes to software developers and other skilled occupations too, is that none of these factors can fully account for the San Jose premium. Software developers in San Jose are typically slightly less experienced, and while their levels of education are higher—including their likelihood of having majored in engineering or computer science—the difference is not enough to explain their elevated earnings. Likewise, the cost of living in San Jose is remarkably high, but comparable to other major cities. \n",

      " \n",
      "To figure this out, I analyzed a database of 29 million job vacancies advertised online during 2013 as compiled by the analytics firm Burning Glass. Of these, roughly 1.4 million were for software application developers, making it the most in-demand occupation. In total, 3 million ads also contained salary information, which I could use to estimate the average value of each distinct skill advertised. \n",

      "In San Jose, the skills advertised for software developers are particularly valuable. The average vacancy requires higher value skills in San Jose than almost any other metropolitan area, even using national rather than local salary values.  \n",
      " \n",
      "For example, 8.4 percent of ads for software developers in San Jose requested Java, a widely used programming language, associated with an average salary of $98,000 across all U.S. ads mentioning both it and a salary requirement. Yet, for the United States as a whole, just 5.7 percent of software developer ads required Java. In New York City, the share was 6.7, and it was 4.7 in Louisville.\n",
      " \n",
      "Other high-value programming languages and skills were disproportionately advertised in San Jose, such as Linux, C++, Python and the term “software engineering.”  These skills were much less commonly required for jobs in Louisville and even New York. Only 0.2 percent of software jobs required Python in Louisville and 1.7 in New York City, compared to 2.8 percent in San Jose. It is valued at $100,345.\n",
      " \n",
      "These and other skills contribute to the high premium enjoyed by Silicon Valley computer workers, but they could be profitably learned by a much larger swath of people, as online educators like Treehouse, Udacity, and Code Fellows aim to demonstrate.\n",

      "URL: Idea to Retire: Old methods of policy education\n",
      "TITLE: \n",
      "Public policy and public affairs schools aim to train competent creators and implementers of government policy. While drawing on the principles that gird our economic and political systems to provide a well-rounded education, like law schools and business schools, policy schools provide professional training. They are quite distinct from graduate programs in political science or economics which aim to train the next generation of academics. As professional training programs, they add value by imparting both the skills which are relevant to current employers, and skills which we know will be relevant as organizations and societies evolve. \n",
      "The relevance of the skills that policy programs impart to address problems of today and tomorrow bears further discussion. We are living through an era in which societies are increasingly interconnected. The wide-scale adoption of devices such as the smartphone is having a profound impact on our culture, communities, and economy. The use of social and digital media and associated means of communication enabled by mobile devices is changing the tone, content, and geographic scope of our conversations, modifying how information is generated and consumed, and changing the very nature of citizen engagement. \n",
      "Information technology-based platforms provisioned by private providers such as Facebook, Google, Uber, and Lyft maintain information about millions of citizens and enable services such as transportation that were mediated in the past solely by the public sector. Surveillance for purposes of public safety via large-scale deployment of sensors also raises fundamental questions about information privacy. From technology-enabled global delivery of work to displacement and replacement of categories of work, some studies estimate that up to 47 percent of U.S. employment might be at risk of computerization with an attendant rise in income inequality. These technology-induced changes will affect every policy domain. How should policy programs best prepare students to address societal challenges in this world that is being transformed by technology? We believe the answer lies in educating students to be “men and women of intelligent action.” \n",
      "A model of policy education\n",
      "We begin with a skills-based model of policy education. These four essential skills address the general problems policy practitioners frequently face:\n",
      "\n",
      "Design skills to craft policy ideas \n",
      "Analytical skills to make smart ex ante decisions \n",
      "Interpersonal experience to manage policy implementation  \n",
      "Evaluative skills to assess outcomes ex post and correct course if necessary\n",
      "\n",
      "These skills make up the policy analysis toolkit required to be data driven practitioner of “intelligent action” in any policy domain. This toolkit needs to be supplemented by an understanding of how technology is transforming societal challenges, enabling new solutions, or disrupting existing regulatory regimes. This understanding is essential to policy formulation and implementation. \n",
      "Pillar 1: Design skills\n",
      "As with engineering, where design precedes analysis, this first pillar seeks to educate students in thinking creatively about problems in order to devise and develop policy ideas. Using ideas derived from design, divergent and convergent thinking principles are employed to generate, explore, and arrive at a candidate set of solutions. Using Uber as an example, an approach to identify and explore the key policy issues such as convenience, costs, driver working hours, and insurance would involve interviewing and observing both incumbent taxi drivers and Uber drivers. This in turn would lead to a set of alternatives that deserve further and careful consideration.  Using these skills, candidate designs and choices that are generated can be evaluated using the policy analytic toolkit. \n",
      "Pillar 2: Analytical skills\n",
      "At Carnegie Mellon, we are often cited in media and interrogated by peers on our approach to analytical and technology skills education. Curiosity about which skills are the “right” skills to teach policy practitioners are common, but we believe this is the wrong approach. We instead begin from the premise that policy or management decisions should be grounded in evidence.  We then determine the skills required to assemble the types of evidence that will likely be available to policy makers in the future.  In increasingly instrumented environments where citizens and infrastructure produce continuous streams of data, making sense of it all will require a somewhat different set of skills. We believe that a grounding in micro-economics, operations research, statistics, and program evaluation (aka causal inference) to be an essential core to policy programs. \n",
      "New coursework will teach students to work with multi-variable data and machine learning with an emphasis on prediction. This material ought to be part of the required coursework in statistics given the importance of prediction in many policy implementation settings. Along the same lines, the ability to work with unstructured data (especially text) and data visualization will become increasingly relevant to all students, not just those students who want to specialize in data analytics. Finally, knowledge of data manipulation and analysis languages such as Python and R for analytic work will be important because data often has to be massaged and cleansed prior to analysis. An important task for programs will be to determine the competencies expected of graduates. \n",
      "Pillar 3: Interpersonal experiences\n",
      "The third pillar of the skills-based model is interpersonal experience, where the practiced habits of good communication and steady negotiation developed with a sound understanding of organizations, their design and their behaviors. We label these purposely as experiences rather than skills because we believe they are best practiced either in the real-world or in simulated real-world settings. It is also in this pillar where practitioners learn the knowledge necessary to become credible experts in their domain. We believe that in addition to core coursework in the area, a supplementary curriculum which provides students with opportunities to gain these experiences is an essential component of our educational model.\n",

      "The ability to carefully diagnose the effectiveness of policy or management interventions is the fourth pillar of our model. It is insufficient to create and execute policy without measurement, and this is where both careful thought to the fundamental issues of measurement and evaluation become important. The ability to make objective judgments on the benefits, liabilities, and unintended consequences of prior policies is the goal of this set of skills. Here, sound statistical and econometric training with an understanding of the principles of causal inference is essential. In addition, program evaluation skills such as cost-benefit and financial analysis help practitioners round out their evaluation skills by considering both non-monetary and economic impacts.\n",
      "What should be retired?\n",
      "A skills-based approach might replace certain aspects of existing policy training.  This depends on a number of factors specific to each institution, but three generally applicable observations are clear. First, real-world experiences are a powerful way to encode domain learning as well as project management skills. Through project-based work, students can learn about institutional contexts in specific policy domains and political processes such as budgeting. Second, team-based projects allow students to learn and apply principles of management and organizational behavior. At Carnegie Mellon, we refer to these as “systems synthesis” projects, since they require students to adopt a systemic point of view and to synthesize a number of skills in their policy analysis toolkit. Third, interpersonal skills training can be practiced through activities such as weekend negotiation exercises, hackathons, and speaker series. These activities can be highly intentional and fashioned to reinforce skills rather than as a recess from the “real work” of classroom training. Since students complete graduate programs in such a short time, counseling them to focus on outcomes from day one will allow them to choose a reinforcing set of coursework and real-world experiences. \n",
      "In summary, we argue for a model of policy education that views practitioners as future problem solvers. Good policy education must consider the ways in which problems will present themselves, and the ways in which answers will obscure themselves. Rigorous training grounded in the analysis of available evidence and buoyed by real-world interpersonal experiences is a sound approach to relevant, durable policy training.\n",

      "Amidst growing frustration with the cost of higher education, complaints also abound about its quality. One critique, launched in the book Academically Adrift by two sociologists, finds little evidence that college students score better on measures of critical thinking, writing, and reasoning after attending college. This is something of a paradox, since strong evidence shows that attending college tends to raise earnings power, even for students who start with mediocre preparation. \n",
      "Our recent study uses a different approach to assess the value of a college education. We find that the particular skills listed by a college’s alumni on their resumes predict how well graduates from those schools perform in terms of earning a living, meeting debt obligations, and working for high-paying or innovative companies. Since jobs requiring more valuable skills typically require at least some college education, this finding suggests many students are gaining valuable skills from college. But the variation in alumni skills across schools is wide, even after considering the aptitude of the students in terms of their pre-admission test scores. This variation implies that what one studies and where have big effects on economic outcomes.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is widely known that education raises individual earnings, but education—measured in years of study or level of degree—is a very rough measure of learning. Thus, it is not surprising that studies consistently find that skills are an important predictor of economic outcomes. People with higher test scores—another measure of learning—earn higher wages, even with the same level of education. Likewise, graduates with technical degrees earn more, as do workers in occupations requiring more STEM skills. At the international scale, performance on standardized exams has a much stronger statistical relationship with economic outcomes than do years of education, according to a new OECD study.\n",

To match these skills to colleges, we used data from LinkedIn’s college profile pages, which show the 25 most common skills (e.g., customer service, Microsoft Excel, Python) listed by alumni from each college. For the average college, we observed 1,150 profiles per skill. (A great advantage of using LinkedIn data is the large sample size.) We obtained data for 2,164 colleges representing profiles for 2.5 million U.S. residents who attended college. By comparison, Academically Adrift surveyed 2,300 college graduates.\n",

Here too, more valuable skills translate into labor market success. For example, not a single Harvey Mudd attendee between 2009 and 2011 defaulted on his or her federal loans within three years of leaving. Repayment rates average 95 percent for four-year colleges in the top 10 percent for alumni skills but 87 percent for those in the bottom 10 percent.

      "Earnings and other economic outcomes should not be equated with social value, and there are plenty of jobs and professions—child care, teaching, social work—that pay modestly but are nevertheless highly valuable to society. Colleges that specialize in this training or instill even moderately valuable skills in the least academically prepared students may be socially important institutions even if their alumni frequently are less affluent.\n",
      "Nonetheless, earnings clearly matter privately and socially, as does work that supports innovation and highly productive advanced industries. Many colleges offer programs of study in fields that appear to have almost no market value—nor even any social value since the knowledge acquired is never put to use, at least through paid employment. In this sense, how well colleges instill highly valuable skills and prepare students to contribute productively to the economy should be an important consideration when evaluating schools. Colleges that do this for the students least likely to otherwise succeed are offering an even more beneficial service, as we have discussed in our value-added college research.\n",

      "TITLE: \n",
      "In response to the rising prominence of artificial intelligence and after years of investment in digitalization, Germany has taken new steps to institutionalize governmental data analysis. A €239 million investment is building data labs in every ministry and the Chancellery, adding new capacity across the federal government. To succeed, these data labs must be integrated into an already network of ministry data teams, statistical offices, technical services agencies, and government-funded research institutes, raising questions about to best organize the various roles of data analysis in a complex government bureaucracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive overview of the state of governmental data analysis in Germany, offers an assessment of how these data labs can best be used, and provides recommendations for how Germany can further develop its data-driven capabilities.\n",

      "Compared with other wealthy nations, Germany performs below average on international rankings of digitalization and it has been fairly criticized for insufficient progress, despite billions of euros in spending. However, specifically concerning governmental data analysis (a subset of digitalization), the reality is more complex, with Germany lagging in some areas and leading in others. Germany has well-established resources for policy microsimulation and forecasting, making it a leading nation in anticipatory governance. Although historically underutilized, Germany has effective and increasingly formalized approaches to data-driven program evaluation. A few long-standing offices conduct surveys and provide official statistics, although these agencies are highly centralized, and many ministries are struggling with requirements to open data and build data-driven services. Outside of government, data analysis is buoyed by a robust academic environment and growing private sector, offering opportunities to the government to learn and bring in expert talent.\n",
      "Deploying the new data labs with an intentional focus on operational tasks in the federal ministries will make the best use of these resources and help address current shortcomings. To start, the labs should work to ensure the many new data streams from digitalization efforts will be usable for analytical purposes. Because they are placed within the various ministries, these labs are better positioned to develop expertise in implementing algorithmic processes, as compared to other centralized technical agencies. Their placement also uniquely enables the data labs to develop data-data culture and provide domain-specific training on using data within their respective ministries. Finally, the Chancellery’s data lab is best suited to helping the ministry labs overcome shared bureaucratic burdens and playing a coordinating role in emergency situations to enable rapid cross-governmental data analyses.\n",
      "Even with this important new investment in data capacity, there are other steps Germany can take to better institutionalize governmental data analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "Install chief evaluation officers in each ministry’s leadership to better incorporate data-driven evidence into everyday policymaking.\n",
      "Create new pathways for data scientists to enter government to prepare Germany for its long-term talent needs.\n",
      "Seek to better understand its capacities by surveying government employees on their use of data and considering the evolving data needs of regulators.\n",
      "Develop a comprehensive government plan that delineates between the roles of the technology authorities to create accountability and prevent duplication of efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "introduction\n",
      "The German government has a history of data analysis that extends back even before Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III, who created the Royal Prussian Statistical Bureau in 1805.1 Yet recent trends, especially the huge investment in digital services2 and the rising prominence of artificial intelligence (AI), have heightened interest in how data can improve governance. In January 2021, the Federal Data Strategy called for all federal ministries to hire a Chief Data Scientist.3 Shortly thereafter, the German Recovery and Resilience Plan reiterated this requirement and allocated €239 million to establish a data lab in every ministry and the Chancellery.4 These investments are intended to build on top of the multi-billion euro investment in digitalizing government services,5 and beyond its own borders, Germany has placed itself at the center of Europe’s digitalization efforts through the 2020 Berlin Declaration on Digital Society.6\n",
      "This renewed focus on data will likely persist into Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s new government—the first section of the new Chancellor’s coalition agreement is entitled “Modern State, Digital Awakening and Innovation,” and calls for federal administration not only to become more digital, but also more proactive in supporting citizens.7 Clearly, there are changes to come, as evinced by the expanded scope of technology issues given to the newly renamed Ministry for Digital Affairs and Transportation.8 Despite these new responsibilities, government digitalization is fairly dispersed, with important roles for the Ministries for Interior, Finance, Education and Research, Economic Affairs and Climate Action, International Development, and Foreign Affairs. As for the Chancellery, it seems that Chancellor Scholz may have less interest in leading these efforts than his predecessor, Angela Merkel.9\n",
      "“Data analysis is becoming ever more important to core functions of governance, both through existing mechanisms, such as official statistics and program evaluation, but also more recent developments such as algorithmic processes.”\n",
      "Regardless of who leads these efforts, the German government should work to develop a comprehensive and long-term vision for effective public sector data use. Data analysis is becoming ever more important to core functions of governance, both through existing mechanisms, such as official statistics and program evaluation, but also more recent developments such as algorithmic processes. The rapid advance of private sector applications of data also poses a challenge, creating a stark contrast to antiquated government services that can undermine trust in public institutions, and further challenges governments to learn and adapt data science methods for regulating the private sector.\n",
      "These trends are evident today, and so governmental capacity for data analysis should be considered a foundational pillar of modernizing Germany’s public administration.\n",
      "data Analysis capacity in german federal governance\n",
      "Understanding the current state of data and digitalization in the German public sector is a prerequisite for effectively deploying new resources—such as the data labs—and identifying what other steps Germany should take. A recent report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) categorizes the value of data to governance into three broad activities: (1) anticipation and planning; (2) service delivery; and (3) evaluation and monitoring.10 These categories offer a useful starting point for the German context, where digitalization and new algorithmic processes are changing service delivery. Anticipatory governance has seen recent changes too, with new approaches to microsimulation and an increased interest in forecasting. Further, Germany has established systems for monitoring through program evaluation, official statistics, and open data, although many challenges remain. Still, it is important to go beyond the OECD’s framing, and consider a fourth category of (4) related non-governmental factors, especially civil society, academia, and the private sector. The four-part typology is undoubtedly flawed[i] and omits many important topics,[ii] but it provides a useful framework to broadly divide how the German government is using data analysis.\n",
      "(1) Anticipatory Governance\n",
      "Anticipatory governance is the use of data to better forecast the future state of policy-relevant information (usually with statistical forecasting models) and more rigorously estimate the effect of policy changes (usually with microsimulation models). The German government funds a range of sophisticated microsimulation models for analyzing potential policy changes that are maintained by independent research firms and academics. This includes MikroSim, a novel and complex effort to simulate each of Germany’s more than 10,000 municipalities for population dynamics, education, and income, using synthetic population data.11 Other examples include tax and transfer models from at least five institutes,12 as well as Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research’s corporate taxation model,13 and an old-age insurance model from the Fraunhofer Institute.14 Beyond the policy planning value of these models, they also demonstrate the capacity of German policy research institutes to develop large and resource-intensive data-driven modeling systems.\n",
      "Several German policy institutions also work on statistical forecasting models that are used to make predictions about the likely outcome of future trends and are considered valuable for anticipatory governance. Economic forecasts are the most common, including estimates of GDP, inflation, employment, and even sectoral-specific metrics.1516 The Joint Economic Forecast, a collaboration between five independent research institutes, pools data-driven predictions for a biannual report to guide economic policy.17 Environmental models, such as those for measuring flood risk, are also used to inform emergency preparedness.18 In response to the recent prominence of immigration issues, various research institutes1920 and the Federal Office of Migration and Refugees21 are also making attempts to forecast future migration demand into Germany. The Federal Foreign Office’s PREVIEW is an attempt to build a crisis early warning system which started in 2017.22 Overall, these anticipatory government efforts are well-developed, although much of the capacity for this type of data analysis lies outside the federal government.\n",
      "(2) Data-driven service delivery\n",
      "Germany’s enormous investments in government digitalization, led by the Interior Ministry,23 is significantly increasing the amount of data and data infrastructure across the government. The Online Access Act and subsequent decisions will allocate over €5 billion to digitize nearly 600 different types of government services, affecting all 15 federal ministries, as well as 16 state and over 11,000 local governments.24 However, as of mid-2021, only 54 services were available online. [iii] A federal advisory agency, the National Regulatory Control Council (NKR), has determined that, despite recent momentum, the program will not meet its target deadline of the end of 2022.25 Still, these extensive digitalization efforts promise to create many new streams of data and additional technical infrastructure that could provide significant opportunities for future data analytics and algorithmic processes.\n",
      "Several authorities are supporting the government digitalization and are relevant to the state of data analysis—especially ITZBund and Digital Service 4 Germany. Starting in 2015, disparate federal IT capacities have been integrated into a consolidated federal office, ITZBund,26 including the Bundescloud, a new national cloud service. This Bundescloud offers several basic cloud services,27 including a software development platform that could be used for data science applications.28 This is part of Germany’s “multi-cloud approach,”29 which aims to both encourage private providers to offer cloud services using data centers in Germany,3031 and develop its own internal government cloud capacity.32 Digital Service 4 Germany is a notable technical services agency housed in the Chancellery,33 akin to the United States Digital Service. Although Digital Services 4 Germany is more focused on digitalization and software development, its work will often overlap with data analysis and data science applications.\n",
      "Germany is also seeking to reduce administrative burdens on users of government services, the purpose behind the Register Modernization Act of 2020. This law seeks to advance the “once-only principle,” meaning users of government services are only asked to supply a data point once, not multiple times by different forms or ministries.34 Reducing administration burdens, as required by the European Union’s (EU) Single Digital Gateway Regulation,35 is the primary goal, but this regulation has the added value of necessitating interoperability and a common identifier between various ministry databases—furthering the databases’ value for data analytic purposes. The most prominent example is that this integration can more easily enable the counting of the German population, which does not conduct a survey-based census.36 Recently, the NKR said the register modernization effort was “still in its infancy.”37\n",
      "Beyond simply replacing paper with electronic forms, ministries have begun to expand the use of algorithms in government processes formerly performed by people. One example is the Ministry of Labor’s newly-automated analysis of forms required for government child support payments.38 While document processing is relatively commonplace in government, more ambitious projects are also in the works, such as the Ministry for Digital Affairs and Transportation’s trial project to automate highway damage monitoring.39 A recent report on the use of AI in public authorities documents these and ten other cases studies, but also notes that governments needs more data analytics talent, as well as better standards for the use of algorithms in government.40 A survey of federal ministries by the Ministry of Education and Research publicly documented 79 deployed AI systems41 and 190 further pilot and research projects,42 although the information is sparse. Of the deployed systems, almost none had gone through any algorithmic risk assessment, and several ministries seemed not to even understand the concept of an algorithmic risk assessment.43 Of the 79 documented AI systems, 35 were developed internally by ministries and 35 were externally developed by private companies or universities. ITZBund is involved in developing the remaining nine AI services for other ministries, including the Ministry of Finance, the Customs Investigation Bureau, the Federal Tax Office, and the Financial Intelligence Unit.44\n",
      "(3) Monitoring and evaluation\n",
      "Germany has a mature program of official statistics, largely run by a few independent federal authorities with deep expertise, especially the Federal Statistical Office of Germany (Destatis),45 the Institute for Employment Research,46 and the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).47 Destatis is the principal data owner, and has its own extensive digitalization plan that aims to bring together its own survey data, ministry registry data, and external experimental data collections.48 All these authorities are experimenting with emerging data science approaches, such as IER using digital trace data for labor market measures,49 Destatis using mobile phone data to see effects of COVID restrictions on mobility,50 and RKI making use of citizen’s data donations.51 While Germany displays mature capacities in official statistics, the federal statistical functions are relatively centralized in these few authorities[iv] and are progressively more directed by E.U. requirements.52\n",
      "Data-driven program evaluation remains among the most critical contributions of governmental data use,53 but its use in Germany has been only recently, and partially, systematized. In 2013, an effort started to create a systematic evaluation procedure for all laws and regulations estimated to have over €1 million in compliance costs,54 but otherwise, there is no federal or state law requiring program evaluation.55 Despite no universal standard, it has become increasingly common for laws to include clauses that require an ex-post evaluation some years after the law’s implementation.\n",
      "While the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development has had an evaluation unit since 197156 as well as an associated institute,57 this is the exception, not the norm. Evaluations are frequent in some other policy fields, especially in labor policy,5859 social programs, and higher education.60 The government leans heavily on the economic and social science research institutes in the Leibniz Association and Fraunhofer Society, as well as private contractors61 to perform this work.62 This may reflect a somewhat recent change, as, at the prompting of the German Research Council, many of the Leibniz Association institutes made significant investments in evidence-based policy during the 2000s.63 External institutes are generally able to work with the government administrative data necessary to perform these ex-post evaluations. Despite starting later relative to its peer countries, Germany has quickly developed an expansive system of researcher access to sensitive administrative data.64 The German Data Forum now has accredited 38 research data centers that offer access to this confidential governmental data,65 more than the United States’ 31.66\n",
      "In June 2021, the Bundestag adopted the Second Open Data Act and the Data Usage Act, expanding its commitment to publicly releasing machine-readable data.67 In 2019, two years after the passing of the first open data act, 75% of agencies had an open data officer, but 57% of agencies said there was insufficient staffing for their legal obligations.68 Still, there are currently tens of thousands of datasets on GovData.de centralized data portal, and while the amount of data contributed varies dramatically between federal ministries,69 most will be required to open up data by 2023 under the new open data strategy.70 This also requires an expansion of the number of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for government data by 2024, building on the 30 that are available now.71 Beyond broadening public access to data, the new coalition agreement calls for a new data institute that would help open government data in order to fuel new business models and social innovations.72\n",
      "A final governmental factor is the receptiveness of policymakers to data and evidence, or the culture of evidence-based policymaking. A 2011 expert survey of 19 OECD countries assigned Germany the 2nd lowest score for the use of program evaluations in government.73 This is a concerning rank, but it is based on the presence or absence of formal arrangements for disseminating evaluations to policymakers, and thus does not measure the culture or tendencies of policymakers using evidence. Regardless, there have been signs of progress in the last decade. The Bundestag has also not historically been especially invested in commissioning or using evaluations, but references to empirical evaluations in Bundestag materials nearly quintupled (568 to 2451) from the 15th Bundestag (2002-2005) to the 18th Bundestag (2013-2017).74 Several organizations are also working to improve the culture of evidence, including the German Economic Association, which released principles for better evidence-based policymaking,75 and the Halle Institute, which founded a Centre for Evidence-based Policy Advice.76 In 2021, the Federal Academy for Public Administration launched the Digital Academy77 to train public servants in digital skills, including data literacy.78 These developments reflect a growing appreciation that the value of government data is not automatic, but must be understood and consciously integrated into policymaking.\n",
      "(4) Non-governmental factors: Civil society, academia, and the private sector\n",
      "There are several external factors that will significantly affect the government’s ability to make advances on data use. This includes academic programs as key pipelines of new data talent and independent civil society organizations that can drive new data science applications. Further, the general perspective and opinion of German citizens matters, as politics impacts what is possible for government data.\n",
      "Nonprofit organizations have begun to develop lines of data science work that complement government efforts. The nonprofits Correlaid, DatenSchule, Data Science for Social Good-Berlin, and Code for Germany offer partnerships and trainings to help bring data expertise into social good organizations. Other organizations have recently started to build data capacity for studying societal problems, including the think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung79 and the Bertelsmann Foundation.80 The German government is also supporting some civil society experimentation with AI through small (€20,000) grants awarded by the new Civic Innovation Platform.81\n",
      "Academia also plays a key role, both by creating pipelines of new talent for civil service and performing informative research. There is an emerging cohort of master’s programs that specifically focus on data and governance. These include programs focused on applied data science and how it overlaps with policy, as in the Hertie School’s M.S. in Data Science for Public Policy,82 or social science, as in the University of Konstanz’s MSc in Social and Economic Data Science.83 Mannheim University’s new Master of Applied Data Science and Measurement has a unique emphasis on the challenges of data collection, particularly useful in governance.84 Also notable is Friedrich-Alexander University, which is one of the partner institutions in the new E.U.-funded Master of AI for Public Services.85 More broadly than policy and social science, Germany leads the EU in specialized AI academic programs.86\n",
      "The academic research community in data analytics, AI, and related fields is also quite strong. Germany ranks around fifth or sixth in a number of AI publications, depending on the precise metric used.87 To improve further, the National AI Strategy called for 100 new AI professorships, and various efforts such as those by the state of Bavaria88 and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation may help Germany exceed this goal.89 Especially valuable to governance are the programs that focus on the overlap between data science and social sciences, such as those mentioned above.\n",

      "The private sector, whose skills and expertise can be harnessed and exchanged with the federal government, is also a strength for Germany. Looking at both academia and the private sector, Germany has the most researchers working in science and technology in the EU.90 In terms of talent, Germany’s private sector ranks 6th in both investment in AI and in AI hiring. Further, Germany ranks 4th among 13 leading countries in AI skill prevalence (27% higher than the global average) and is especially strong in the industries of Hardware, as well as Networking and Manufacturing.91 However, according to the European Investment Bank, Germany lags behind both the United States and the EU average in the digitalization of other private industries, including construction, services, and infrastructure.92\n",
      "Finally, as in any democracy, the perspective and the trust of the German people are key factors in its government’s continued ability to use data. One approach is to consider the extent to which German citizens use digital services, although these numbers vary: the EU’s Digital Economy and Society Index reported that in 2020, 69% of citizens in the past year had used a digital government service.93 However, a report from the German government says that only 40% of citizens submitted a form or application to the government online in the past year.94 This disparity may reflect that German citizens would prefer to use online government services, but are stymied by the common requirement of paper form submissions with handwritten signatures.95 The same report found that 40.7% of Germans saw AI as an asset, compared to 26.5% who saw it as a threat—these numbers coming before the government of neighboring Netherlands had to resign over an algorithm that erroneously punished families for benefits fraud.9697 A 2014 poll found that the German people were especially concerned with data privacy, with 80% being reluctant to share data with businesses.98 However, Germans showed more trust in their government in a 2018 survey, with just over 40 percent expressing concerns about data security in online public services.99\n",
      "Summary and international framing \n",
      "Overall, these factors describe a mature governmental use of data, with Germany lagging other wealthy nations in several areas and leading in a few. There are a few international rankings from the EU, UN, and OECD that warrant consideration, although they tend to focus more on law and procedure and less on harder-to-measure ‘on-the-ground’ factors that might be more informative. The European Commission’s (EC’s) Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) estimates that Germany’s digital public services are about average among EU members.100 This top-level estimate masks significant variation within the sub-indicators, as Germany ranks 8th in open data, 10th in e-Government users, 12th in digital public services for businesses, 16th in digital public services for citizens, and 23rd in pre-filled forms (which is a useful proxy for how interconnected ministry databases are).101\n",
      "The OECD’s Digital Government Index is more critical, putting Germany third to last in its ranking of “data-driven public sector.” However, this analysis was last performed in 2019, and counts against Germany several points that have since been rectified, including the lack of a public sector data policy, no plan for intragovernmental data sharing, and no requirement of chief data officers.102 The United Nations E-Government Survey scored Germany as in middle country among 33 European nations evaluated. Despite a strong showing on Germany’s human capital development, the UN scored Germany poorly on the government digital services—an analysis that aligns with that of the EC’s DESI.103\n",
      "Germany’s capacities in microsimulation models and independent researcher access to government administrative data are areas in which the country leads. The academic environment is also relatively strong, both in AI research generally, and specifically in emerging pipelines of public-sector technical talent. This is critical because having an expansive talent pool makes it far easier to rectify other capacity issues in the short term. More broadly, however, non-governmental civil society efforts are nascent and appear to be trying to catch up to current practices, rather than innovating and leading.\n",
      "Policy and operational recommendations\n",
      "This section discusses the additional steps to improve Germany’s public sector data capacities, but it is first worth discussing what should be done with changes already in progress—specifically, the new ministry data labs, the Chancellery’s data lab, and the Data Service Center. The data labs are best placed to use data to directly support the operational work of ministries through developing data pipelines, implementing algorithmic services, and fostering an analytical culture. The Chancellery data lab is better suited for a coordinating role, especially for emergencies, as well as enabling the ministry labs to overcome bureaucratic challenges. Finally, the new Data Service Center can handle especially difficult technical challenges that are shared across the data labs and other centers of data analysis.\n",
      "Beyond establishing these offices, Germany should consider a range of other policies to improve its capacity for, and use of, data analysis. To improve the internal capacity and the culture of evidence-based policy, Germany should require and fund a chief evaluation officer in every ministry and consider other new entry points for technical talent. To better learn about the current state of capacity, Germany should employ surveys of government employees on these topics, and especially consider the evolving role of regulatory data science, which has so far been under-discussed. The federal government should also develop a central strategy and organizational chart that clearly defines the roles of the many public agencies with data analytics responsibilities. Finally, there are further steps that can be taken to strengthen data science in relevant civil society organizations.\n",
      "Ministry data labs should focus on operational data science\n",
      "The newly-installed or incoming chief data scientists and their data labs should focus on the tasks that benefit most from using internal data talent and also address Germany’s deficiencies in institutional data. Broadly, the data tasks that meet both of these criteria are operational, in that they directly support day-to-day ministerial function, as opposed to data-driven evaluations or anticipatory governance. Of course, the needs of different ministries will vary, but generally, data labs should give special priority to the following operational tasks:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensuring data from digitalization is analytically usable: The enormous effort by German ministries, states, and localities to digitize their public services does not guarantee that the resulting data will be useful for analytical purposes. Data labs can and should play a key role by being an advocate for effective collection, documentation, and storage of digital services data so that it is valuable for other purposes. Given the rapid pace and enormous scale of the digitalization efforts, this is likely a time-consuming, but highly important, line of work. This work aligns well with a task explicitly handed to the data labs by the Recovery Plan, which is to build a nationwide Data Atlas.104 As the data labs better document their own databases, they should also collaborate to build this cross-ministerial overview of all federal government data.\n",
      "Building data-driven culture and capacity: Data labs can also work to enable broader data access and use within their ministry. This might mean helping employees get database access where ministry employees can themselves perform data analysis, or through dashboards, where data has been preprocessed and visualized for them. One model for this work is the U.S. Commerce Department’s Data Academy, which in 2016 and 2017 put on a series of trainings105 for over 1,600 departmental staff to improve their data analytics capacity.106 The Commerce data team also used these trainings to identify strong candidates for more advanced data education, helping create new centers of expertise across the department. In doing trainings, the ministry data labs should be careful not to build duplicative content with that of the National Digital Academy, which already has at least one course on data literacy.107 The data labs should instead go deeper into ministerial-specific data and how it can inform the day-to-day work of ministry staff. The data labs will be uniquely positioned to do this because of their proximity to operational employees and expertise working with ministry-specific data.\n",
      "Data-driven and algorithmic processes: Due to their proximity to the front lines of government service delivery, the new data labs can work to identify existing processes that would most benefit from automation and algorithms. This can help address the relatively poor performance of Germany’s digital public services, as well as the shortage of AI talent as reported in the aforementioned AI in public authorities report. To be most successful, the new data labs should generally work to improve upon workflows that ministries are already doing rather than attempting to build entirely new processes. While improving the function of government should be the core goal of the data labs, there is some evidence that these investments in analytics can also save significant funds by reducing fraud and waste.108\n",
      "Institutionalize new data pipelines: The data labs are well-positioned to build new data collection pipelines, bringing novel external data into governance. The authorities with established data capacities already do some of this work (i.e., Destatis, RKI, and IER, as mentioned in the monitoring and evaluation section), but most do not. Where possible, ministry data labs should build on successful proof-of-concepts from academia and civil society, and use the consistency of government funding to productionize (or make permanent and sustainable) the data pipelines. Ideally, these new data collections would both inform ministry function and be released to the public as open data.\n",
      "\n",
      "These priorities are core functions of governance and would be an investment in the areas that German governance needs most. Reflecting this, the data labs should also strive to build internal capacity, while minimizing procurement or outsourcing. One reason the data labs are so valuable is they can offer routine interaction between ministerial staff and data analysis expertise, which is where the operational value of data analysis is realized. Further, data analysis is a core and structural function of government, not the short-term projects or insulated deliverables that are suitable for consulting or contracting. This means the procured software and solutions are likely to be permanent costs, risking vendor lock-in while losing internal capacity and undermining data-driven culture.109 The data labs should keep as much funding internally as possible, using open-source software and creating new tools that government can iterate and improve on over time.\n",
      "“One reason the data labs are so valuable is they can offer routine interaction between ministerial staff and data analysis expertise, which is where the operational value of data analysis is realized.”\n",
      "While these operational tasks should be done in-house, not all data analyses need to be performed internally, and this roadmap for the data labs intentionally prioritizes a few tasks and leaves others out. For instance, the performance of program evaluation is not best served by the data labs, as this can continue to be done by independent research organizations. Program evaluations are a lengthy and complex type of data analysis that often takes months or years, and so an independent institute can perform and deliver results intermittently. Further, it is an advantage to have program evaluation done by independent research organizations that may be less prone to political influence when reporting their findings. This is also true for microsimulation and forecasting tasks, in contrast to operational data analysis and algorithmic systems in the federal government where outside research institutes would be less effective. Otherwise, procurement should largely be used for either general-purpose software and tasks that are common in both government and private sector, or for highly specialized projects that government cannot reasonably be expected to do.\n",
      "Similarly, the continued development of APIs is also not an ideal goal for data labs, although they may contribute to the process by cleaning and preparing data. This task is better categorized as data engineering than data analysis, and while it requires a specific set of technical skills, its execution is less specific to the domain knowledge. This means that a single entity, for instance the Digital Services 4 Germany or ITZBund, could develop expertise in API development and perform this task across the ministries, rather than having each data lab learn to build high-quality APIs. More broadly, it may prevent duplicative work and prevent conflict if Digital Services 4 Germany, ITZBund, and other technical agencies generally leave data analytic work that requires domain knowledge and routine interaction with ministry staff to the ministry data labs.\n",
      "The Chancellery’s data lab as coordinator and enabler\n",
      "The strategic location of the new data lab within the Chancellor’s office, without a specific ministerial function to support and so close to the highest levels of policymaking, warrants a different approach. The Chancellor’s data lab should invest in the capacity to perform rapid cross-governmental data analyses to respond to emergency situations. This approach was pioneered by the New York City Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA), where the team practiced “data drills” to better execute the interdepartmental integration of data sets.110 MODA developed this approach after the office encountered difficulties combining datasets in an (ultimately successful) effort to use data science to help respond to the 2015 outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease in New York City.111 Similarly, due to its location within the White House, the United States Digital Service has also been known to work on high-pressure interagency data and technology problems. By using its centrality and political authority, the Chancellery data lab can bring together data experts from across government ministries, quickly break down barriers, and deliver emergency data services.\n",
      "This work would also help the Chancellor’s data lab identify barriers to collaboration, which aligns well with a second stream of pertinent work: coordinating and advocating for the structural and bureaucratic changes necessary to support the ministerial data labs. This portfolio might also include enabling the use of open-source programming languages for data science, such as R and Python,[v] or expanding access to collaborative development software such as git. It could also include ensuring that ministry data labs can hire data science talent with appropriate titles and pay scales, which is called for by the Federal Data Strategy and has been done for other IT specialists.112 It may also be worth ensuring that funding streams are consistent and flexible enough such that ministries have a real choice between hiring permanent staff and using procurement.\n",
      "The importance of these bureaucratic changes should not be downplayed. The needs of civic technology and data analysis in the United States has led to fundamental changes, including smaller and faster procurement (called modular contracting113), new job titles,114 and may even result in a dramatically improved federal hiring process.115 This is a sufficiently critical line of work to warrant making permanent the head of the Chancellery data lab and creating the title of Chief Data Scientist (or Officer) of the federal government, a role that has existed in the United States since 2015.116\n",
      "The Data Service Center can provide technical expertise\n",
      "The Federal Data Strategy also calls for the creation of a new office, the Data Service Center (DSC), for cooperating around data use and evidence-based evaluation. While the Chancellery’s data lab should take the lead on bureaucratic challenges to data use, the DSC can instead tackle technical challenges that are shared across the data labs. This might include specializing in providing guidance and support for challenging data-specific tasks related to open data, cloud-based analysis, and algorithmic services.\n",
      "The DSC may be especially valuable in helping develop best practices for the expanding number of algorithmic services being built by federal ministries. For instance, this includes collaborating across ministries and data labs to create standardized reporting, as in the UK,117 as well as a public registry of algorithms, as has been implemented by both Amsterdam and Helsinki,118 and is in progress in the United States.119 This registry can build on the survey by the Ministry of Education and Research, but should be formalized, placed on a public website, given substantially more detail, and updated regularly.\n",
      "“The DSC may be especially valuable in helping develop best practices for the expanding number of algorithmic services being built by federal ministries.”\n",
      "Further, ministries should assess the potential level of harm and develop formalized processes for minimizing that risk, such as benchmarking the algorithm’s performance to an ongoing human comparison.120 Canada’s algorithmic impact assessment tool121 and the Ada Lovelace Institute’s algorithmic impact assessment case study122 are both potential models for this work.\n",
      "Drawing precise boundaries between the DSC and other existing agencies may be challenging and should be done carefully. For instance, the DSC might provide best practices for the process of opening up government data, such as for data cleaning, anonymization processes, and stakeholder engagement. However, hosting the open data should still be left to the\n",
      "Ministry of Interior’s GovData.de platform team and the DSC may not be best suited to support API development, since this is a separate set of specialized skills more similar to web development, for which expertise may already exist in technology agencies like Digital Service 4 Germany or ITZBund. Similarly, while the DSC should not replicate ITZBund’s effort to create cloud services, it could instead develop expertise in interoperable data analysis tools to aid various data teams to work effectively with the multi-cloud strategy.\n",
      "Other recommendations and lessons from the United States\n",
      "Starting under the Obama administration, the United States renewed a focus on civic technology and data science which has since produced significant progress, although with noteworthy missteps. These efforts illustrate several possibilities for Germany to improve other aspects of data-driven governance, beyond those discussed above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Install chief evaluation officers—To further improve the institutionalization of evidence-based policymaking, Germany should consider adding a chief evaluation officer to every federal ministry. Evaluation officers look to actively incorporate existing empirical evidence (from government and external sources) into everyday policymaking. This is distinct from the data labs and chief data scientists in that evaluation officers are only reviewing and synthesizing evidence for imminent policy choices. Since ministries are strong pillars of federal policymaking and are hierarchical in nature, placing evaluation officers directly subordinate to the Minister (in the Leitungsbereich) could be highly impactful. Evaluation officers might also review ministry functions to identify necessary evaluations and build further infrastructure to improve their quality.123 These officers could also further formalize the role of evaluation in the ministries, both by documenting the current state of evaluation use, and by writing an official policy detailing the circumstances in which the ministry performs program evaluations.124\n",
      "Create new government talent pathways—Germany has an aging public workforce, with the proportion of government employees aged 18-34 falling from 30% in 2020 to 15% in 2015.125 Beyond the employees and trainings of the data labs, policymakers should also look to enable new pathways for data science talent. For instance, the Chancellery could build on the success of the tech4Germany fellowship, which brings technologists into the federal government for three-month sprints,126 to include data science projects. Developing a program analogous to the U.S.’s Civic Digital Fellowship, which attracts technically talented students to government internships, is another option.127 Lastly, Germany should consider creating a Chancellery Innovation Fellowship, analogous to the Presidential Innovation Fellowship, and using the prestige of such an opportunity to bring in high-quality talent that might not have otherwise considered government service. The strong academic environment in Germany makes it more likely that programs like this can be successful in helping build internal capacity, and Germany should also consider how to best improve exchanges and networking between these sectors.128\n",
      "Consider the data needs of regulators—The oversight responsibilities of government ministries are also becoming more data-intensive, meaning that many public authorities will eventually need to be able to securely analyze private data for regulatory purposes.129 This will be especially true for ministries that are handed obligations through new EU legislation such as the AI Act.130 Although Germany has developed some relevant expertise through implementing the General Data Protection Regulation, most of the oversight from this act is enforced at the state level.131 In the near future, Germany will likely need to consider how its data infrastructure can support the expanding data analysis requirements of its regulating agencies.\n",
      "Survey government employees about data use—The analysis and discussion in this report are significantly limited by a lack of information about the everyday use of data by federal employees. It is not clear how capable the average federal employee is in interpreting, collecting, or analyzing data, nor is it clear if they have necessary data access for their jobs. Surveys of selected subsections of federal employees could shed further light on these questions, as well as how competencies vary across ministries. In the United States, the Data Foundation has developed surveys for senior data staff, including chief data officers132 and chief evaluation officers.133 Germany should implement internal government surveys and monitoring that get at these questions, both of senior staff such as the new chief data scientists, and of other federal employees who do not primarily work as data analysts.\n",
      "Delineate clear boundaries between technology authorities—A range of agencies and authorities have responsibilities relevant to governmental data use, including ITZBund, Digital Service 4 Germany, Destatis, the GovData.de platform team, as well as the upcoming ministry data labs, the Data Service Center, and the possible new data institute, among others. This ecosystem is sufficiently complex that these agencies are likely to build repetitive and overlapping expertise without a single document or strategy that clearly divides up organizational responsibilities. If an emergency data analysis is needed by the Chancellery, does the ministry data lab perform it, or can Digital Service 4 Germany? If a new data tool would help several ministries, does this task fall to the Data Service Center or ITZBund? A single governmental document with clear organizational responsibilities and boundaries could help answer these questions, and offer a comprehensive government-wide vision for data analytics responsibilities.\n",
      "Strengthen data science in civil society—Germany’s civil society policy research institutions, including think tanks, have only limited capacity in emerging data science methods, hampering innovation in civic data science. In the United States, independent think tanks lead the government on innovative uses of data science for policy research. For example, the Center for Security and Emerging Technology’s Map of Science, a categorization and analysis of 260 million scientific documents,134 enables conclusions about which countries are leading in AI-driven robotics research (i.e., that Germany leads the world in robotics for automotive engineering).135 Alternatively, the Urban Institute creates novel data systems for policymaking, such as the Spatial Equity Data Tool, which identifies geographic disparities across populations and the distribution of government services.136 These are just two examples of how civil society organizations can develop new data applications that government can use and build on. In Germany, while the Civic Innovation Platform has provided some funding for civil society innovation with data, 137 the €20,000 awards are not sufficient to support ongoing institutional efforts. Germany should increase this funding or create a new line of grants for expanding data science in independent policy research.\n",

      "[i] It is challenging to categorize governmental data use, which has both dependencies (e.g., analysis depends on data collection and storage) as well as cyclical elements (e.g., data analysis can affect what data is collected). Further, some data analyses may serve multiple purposes—a study intended to decide on an intervention’s efficacy might also be used to guide its future implementation (planning).

      "India has been struck hard by the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic—daily cases and deaths peaked at more than 400,000 cases and 4,000 deaths, respectively, almost four to five times higher than the peak number of cases and deaths in the first wave.1 The second wave was largely attributed to complacency by the Indian government.2 As important as this may have been, it is crucial to examine the role of the media during the pandemic. In particular, what were the discussion topics on the eve of the second wave, and was COVID-19 a fading topic of discussion when the tragedy struck? In this paper, we answer this question and discuss how inadequate media coverage may have slowed India’s COVID-19 response.\n",

      "News media is an important institution in a democracy. It is instrumental in conveying information to people and drawing the government’s attention to issues of concern, and provides a platform for advocacy and criticism of policies of the government in power.3 In the context of a pandemic, the media’s role becomes even more significant: It can be a vital source to identify early outbreaks, and it can inform the public about non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like maintaining physical distance, hand hygiene, wearing a mask, etc. to contain the spread of the disease and limit its impact.4 Although NPIs and government-imposed travel restrictions can be burdensome—requiring significant alterations in human behavior, which is difficult to maintain over extended periods5—the media can ensure compliance with these important measures by educating the public on their effectiveness at fighting diseases and preventing additional outbreaks.\n",
      "Furthermore, research on epidemics has shown a cyclical behavioral response with respect to the disease; that is, more disease leads to more demand for self-protection, in turn leading to less disease; however, this results in less self-protection, which then leads to more disease.6 Unfortunately, this implies that until a sufficiently large number of people are vaccinated or protected from the disease, an epidemic is likely to come in waves. Therefore, it becomes imperative for the media and the government to repeatedly, perhaps in a novel manner, convey messages to the public regarding NPIs to the public to lessen the impact of the disease, primarily when the prevalence of the disease is in a downward trend.\n",

      "This paper uses data from Twitter for 20 English-language media outlets across print, digital, and broadcasting and uses structural topic modeling (STM)7 to identify discussion topics and the evolution of these topics during the pandemic from March 2020 to April 2021. Our primary objective was to understand whether, on the eve of the second wave in India, topics related to COVID-19—in contrast to other topics of discussion, such as politics, protests, and entertainment—were a fading topic of discussion.\n",
      "In the Indian context, this is the first paper to our knowledge that relies on Twitter data to look at the role of media during the pandemic using STM methods,8 a machine-assisted text reading tool. Our article complements the literature that has explored how mass media in post-independence India forced the Indian government to respond to threats of famine; as a result of this public pressure, India—despite its high level of poverty—has not had a large-scale famine post-independence.9 Moreover, research has also shown that state governments with a higher circulation of newspapers were more responsive to a decline in food production or damage caused to the crops by flooding.10 These papers highlight how media can draw government attention to issues of grave concern, especially for lower-income and historically disadvantaged groups and areas.\n",

      "To identify tweets for this study, the data were analyzed to identify if “COVID” or “coronavirus” was mentioned in the tweet. If it was mentioned, then the tweet was labeled as a COVID-19 tweet. We then ran a logistic regression of the following form:\n",
      "\n",
      "To get the proportion of tweets labeled as a COVID-19 tweet each month, we compute the average predicted probabilities for each month, using the margins command in STATA MP 16.1.\n",
      "The second part of our analysis involves text mining of the tweets to discover topics associated with the tweet and how these topics evolve for different media outlets. We used STM to analyze the texts of tweets for each media outlet are analyzed using machine-assisted reading of text corpora.12\n",
      "The STM model builds on the probabilistic topic models such as the Latent Dirichlet Allocation,13 Correlated Topic Models,14 and extensions of these models.15 However, the critical innovation in STM is to relate the topic models with information associated with the document or the tweet. In our paper, this information relates to the media outlet and the month they posted the tweet. In other words, STM, while discovering the latent topics in the tweet, also uses the information associated with the tweet, such as the media outlet that posted the tweet and the date when the tweet was posted.\n",
      "Moreover, our structural model also allows the evolution of the topic to vary with each of the media outlets. Our purpose for this is to differentiate the topics of discussion across different media outlets. In particular, in our STM models, topic prevalence takes the following structural form:\n",
      "\n",
      "In this, i is the topic of discussion, and the effect of the month on topic prevalence is estimated with a spline. The media outlet is interacted with the spline of the month to allow for topic prevalence to vary for the media outlet. Since STM can be computationally challenging, we select 10% of the population of tweets. The tweets were selected based on stratified random sampling without replacement. In particular, for each month, we randomly selected 10% of every media outlet’s tweets. A total of 125,606 tweets were part of the STM analysis (see table 1). Before the STM analysis, we prepared the data by removing infrequent words; in our analysis, if a word appears only in one tweet, it is dropped from the vocabulary. Based on this, a total of 107 (<0.1%) tweets were dropped. Our final data for the STM analysis was 125,499 tweets with a vocabulary of 29,999 words. The default initialization that we used was spectral, primarily because of its stability.\n",
      "Next, we took the sample of 125,499 tweets and labeled each tweet with the dominant topic of discussion based on the STM analysis. We then made five categories based on the topic of discussion related to (1) coronavirus, case, vaccine, (2) China, border, import, (3) farmer, protest, law, Delhi, (4) elections, poll, assembly, and (5) others. We created a count of engagement for each tweet, which is the sum of retweets, likes, and replies. We then regress this count over the months while controlling for the media outlet, using negative binomial regression. In particular, we run the following regression:\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, nbreg is negative binomial regression and subscript i is the index for the tweet.\n",
      "Our model selection for the number of topics was based on a data-driven approach. We performed several automated diagnostic tests, such as computation of held-out likelihood and residual analysis and compared the models with the varying topic along each of these criteria. In addition, we also report results associated with semantic-coherence for each of the models.16 There is always a possibility in STMs to produce topics that would be judged nonsensical by human domain experts. To minimize this, we selected the model that had fewer outlier topics based on semantic-coherence and also had higher exclusivity of the topics. Exclusivity of topic refers to words that have high overall frequency but at the same time are exclusive to the topic. Based on our diagnostic tests, we selected a model with 40 topics.\n",
      "We should note that possible limitations of our analysis are that these data are limited to English media outlets and their messages on Twitter. The stories covered on Twitter could be very different from stories covered in print or discussed on news broadcasts, so they are not representative of the overall media discussion. In addition, the audience of the English-language media outlets on social media platforms could be different, for example, from the audience on other vernacular media outlets. It could be possible that other vernacular media outlets have a higher coverage of COVID-19 compared to the English-language media outlets.\n",
      "Results\n",
      "Based on the logistic regression, we found that the average proportion of daily tweets that mention “covid” or “coronavirus” was lowest in February 2021. It fell from a high of 52.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]; 52.6% to 53.3%) in April 2020 to 9.2% (95% CI; 9.0% to 9.4%) in February 2021. This pattern was observed across all the media outlets (see figure 1).\n",

      "Our next set of results relates to the STM analysis. The objective was to exploit the machine-assisted reading of the tweets across all the media outlets to discover the topics of discussion and how each of these topics evolved. Based on model diagnostics (see appendix 1 for a discussion on this), a 40-topic model was estimated with spectral initialization using STM. For our paper, we focus on general topics that relate to (a) COVID-19, coronavirus, vaccine, (b) elections and politics, (c) farmers protests and agitations, and (d) foreign affairs that include border issues with China.\n",
      "Next, we plotted topic prevalence as a smooth function of time, which in our setting is the month (the topic prevalence model was related to the spline of the month), holding the media outlet at the sample median (see figure 2). Our results indicate that topics related to COVID-19 were the dominant topics of discussion from March 2020 until mid-May 2020; from then until the middle of June 2020, the conversation shifted to foreign affairs and border-related issues with China. Beginning in mid-September 2020, the topic of discussion turned to elections and farmers’ protests. State assembly elections in Bihar17 dominated the debate from mid-September until December 2020, when farmers’ protests began to dominate the discussion, even though there was an influx of debate related to COVID-19 vaccination.\n",

      "From early February 2021, state elections (in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry)18 dominated the conversation (see figure 2). Next, we conducted a similar analysis that allowed for topic prevalence to differ across media outlets (see figure 3). Topic prevalence varied across media outlets; for example, for public news agencies such as DD News and PIB India, the dominant topic of discussion in the initial months was related to COVID-19 and coronavirus. However, over time, this declined and shifted to the issues related to finance and projects. For private media outlets in broadcasting, such as IndiaToday, NDTV, TIMES NOW, the dominant topic in the early months of the pandemic was related to COVID-19 and coronavirus; however, in subsequent months, border-related issues with China, elections, and farmers’ protests gained prominence. A similar pattern was observed for print media outlets such as The Hindu, The Indian Express, and The Times of India. However, a common feature across all media outlets was that, on the eve of the second wave (the period between mid-February 2021 and mid-March 2021), topics related to COVID-19 and coronavirus had insignificant coverage relative to other topics; the news instead was focused on topics like farmers protests, India-China border issues, state assembly elections, and cricket.\n",

      "For the next part of the analysis, we study the response that a particular topic elicits from the audience in the form of count of retweets, likes, and replies. In particular, in our sample of 125,499 tweets used for the STM analysis, we label each tweet with the dominant topic of discussion. We then made five categories based on the topic of discussion related to (1) COVID-19, coronavirus, case, and vaccine, (2) China, border, import, (3) farmer, protest, law, Delhi, (4) elections, poll, assembly, and (5) others. Our results indicate that COVID-19 related topics had the least engagement in terms of the number of retweets, likes, and replies compared to other issues—and this trend is consistent across the entire timeline of the study. Issues related to China, elections, and farmers’ protests had significantly higher counts of retweets, likes, and replies (see figure 4). This is an important finding, as it shows that, compared to other topics, there is a relative lack of engagement on (or interest in) topics related to COVID-19 among Twitter users.\n",

      "Conclusion\n",
      "Government complacency was identified as a critical factor for the surge of COVID-19 cases in India during the second wave.19 However, little attention has been paid to the activities of the media on the eve of the second COVID-19 surge, where peak daily cases and deaths were four to five times larger than the peak in the first wave.20 In this paper, using structural topic models based on machine-assisted text reading of tweets, we identify topics of discussion that were making waves in the time of the pandemic in Indian media, and particularly the period immediately before the second surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our results show that discussions related to COVID-19 were at the lowest ebb on the eve of the second wave of the pandemic. Media attention was diverted from COVID-19 to topics related to farmers’ protests, elections, and entertainment (such as cricket matches in the Indian Premier League). This was true across all media outlets—print, broadcasting, and digital, both private and public—with varying agendas.\n",
      "Media is an important institution in a democracy. It conveys information to the public and draws the government’s attention to issues that concern the public. It acts as a bridge between the people and the government. During a global pandemic that has devasted lives and livelihoods, the media’s role becomes crucial. News institutions are essential to bringing the government’s attention to early outbreaks while also nudging, using novel messaging, the tired public to adopt and sustain potentially burdensome NPIs, such as maintaining physical distance and hand hygiene, wearing a mask, etc. to contain the spread of the disease and limit its impact.21 Unfortunately, on the eve of the second COVID-19 surge, discussion related to COVID-19 was at its lowest point across all the media outlets. Moreover, COVID-19 related discussions attracted the least attention on Twitter compared to other topics, such as farmers protests, elections, court cases, and police activity.\n",
      "Our paper has important implications for the future role of media in the Indian context. As we move forward, it is evident that new variants of the virus with varying transmissibility will emerge. There is also limited evidence on the efficacy of existing vaccines on newer variants.22 Therefore, NPIs will continue to play an important role in containing the deadly impact of the virus.23 Given its vast networks of reporters, the media could play a more proactive role in identifying early outbreaks. Secondly, along with the government, the media would need to innovate its messaging regarding the NPIs to the broader public because NPIs are costly to sustain. Thirdly, research on epidemics has shown a cyclical behavioral response with respect to the disease; that is, more disease leads to more demand for self-protection, in turn leading to less disease; however, this results in less self-protection, and this behavior change then leads to more disease.24\n",
      "In light of this, it becomes imperative for both media institutions and governments to reinforce the messaging regarding the pandemic when the prevalence of the disease is at its lowest—which is just the opposite of what we observed in this analysis. Even though media is free to cover any topic in a democracy, we argue that it has to play an essential role during a pandemic to limit the disease’s impact on people. This did not happen on the eve of the second wave, and the lack of relevant information likely intensified the disastrous impact of the wave.\n",

      "Access to education has expanded around the world since the late 1990s through the combined efforts of governments, bilateral and multilateral agencies, donors, civil society, and the private sector, yet education quality has not kept pace. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic led to school closures around the world, all young people were not developing the broad suite of skills they need to thrive in work, life, and citizenship (Filmer, Langthaler, Stehrer, & Vogel, 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of the pandemic on education investment, student learning, and longer-term economic outcomes threatens not only to dial back progress to date in addressing this learning crisis in skills development but also to further widen learning gaps within and between countries. Beyond the immediate and disparate impacts of COVID-19 on students’ access to quality learning, the global economic crisis it has precipitated will shrink government budgets, potentially resulting in lower education investment and impacting the ability to provide quality education (Vegas, 2020). There is also a concern that as governments struggle to reopen schools and/or provide sufficient distance-learning opportunities, many education systems will focus on foundational skills, such as literacy and numeracy, neglecting a broader set of skills needed to thrive in a rapidly changing, technologically-advanced world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Among these broader skills, knowledge of computer science (CS) is increasingly relevant. CS is defined as “the study of computers and algorithmic processes, including their principles, their hardware and software designs, their [implementation], and their impact on society” (Tucker, 2003).1 CS skills enable individuals to understand how technology works, and how best to harness its potential to improve lives. The goal of CS education is to develop computational thinking skills, which refer to the “thought processes involved in expressing solutions as computational steps or algorithms that can be carried out by a computer” (K-12 Computer Science Framework Steering Committee, 2016). CS education is also distinct from computer or digital literacy, in that it is more concerned with computer design than with computer use. For example, coding is a skill one would learn in a CS course, while creating a document or slideshow presentation using an existing program is a skill one would learn in a computer or digital literacy course.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Research has shown that students benefit from CS education by increasing college enrollment rates and developing problem-solving abilities (Brown & Brown, 2020; Salehi et al., 2020). Research has also shown that lessons in computational thinking improve student response inhibition, planning, and coding skills (Arfé et al., 2020). Importantly, CS skills pay off in the labor market through higher likelihood of employment and better wages (Hanson & Slaughter, 2016; Nager & Atkinson, 2016). As these skills take preeminence in the rapidly changing 21st century, CS education promises to significantly enhance student preparedness for the future of work and active citizenship.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The benefits of CS education extend beyond economic motivations. Given the increasing integration of technology into many aspects of daily life in the 21st century, a functional knowledge of how computers work—beyond the simple use of applications—will help all students.\n",

The specific reasons for offering it will be as varied as the countries themselves, though economic arguments often top the list of motivations. Other considerations beyond economics, however, are also relevant, and we account for the most common of these varied motives here.\n",

      "\n",
      "At the macroeconomic level, previous research has suggested that countries with more workers with ICT (information, communications, and technology) skills will have higher economic growth through increases in productivity (Maryska, Doucek, & Kunstova, 2012; Jorgenson & Vu, 2016). Recent global data indicate that there is a positive relationship between the share of a country’s workforce with ICT skills and its economic growth. For example, using data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), we find that countries with a higher share of graduates from an ICT field tend to have higher rates of per capita GDP (Figure 1). The strength of the estimated relationship here is noteworthy: A one percentage point increase in the share of ICT graduates correlates with nearly a quarter percentage point increase in recent economic growth, though we cannot determine the causal nature of this relationship (if any). Nonetheless, this figure supports the common view that economic growth follows from greater levels of investment in technological education.\n",

      "At the microeconomic level, CS skills pay off for individuals—both for those who later choose to specialize in CS and those who do not. Focusing first on the majority of students who pursue careers outside of CS, foundational training in CS is still beneficial. Technology is becoming more heavily integrated across many industrial endeavors and academic disciplines—not just those typically included under the umbrella of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations. Careers from law to manufacturing to retail to health sciences all use computing and data more intensively now than in decades past (Lemieux, 2014). For example, using data from Germany, researchers showed that higher education programs in CS compared favorably against many other fields of study, producing a relatively high return on investment for lower risk (Glocker and Storck, 2014). Notably, completing advanced training in CS is not necessary to attain these benefits; rather, even short introductions to foundational skills in CS can increase young students’ executive functions (Arfe et al., 2020). Further, those with CS training develop better problem-solving abilities compared to those with more general training in math and sciences, suggesting that CS education offers unique skills not readily developed in other more common subjects (Salehi et al., 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For those who choose to pursue advanced CS studies, specializing in CS pays off both in employment opportunities and earnings. For example, data from the U.S. show workers with CS skills are less likely to be unemployed than workers in other occupations (Figure 2). Moreover, the average earnings for workers with CS skills are higher than for workers in other occupations (Figure 3). These results are consistent across multiple studies using U.S. data (Carnevale et al., 2013; Altonji et al., 2012) and international data (Belfield et al., 2019; Hastings et al., 2013; Kirkeboen et al., 2016). Further, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has projected that the market for CS professionals will continue to grow at twice the speed of the rest of the labor market between 2014 and 2024 (National Academies of Sciences, 2018).\n",

      "A common, though inaccurate, perception about the CS field is that anybody with a passion for technology can succeed without formal training. There is a nugget of truth in this view, as many leaders of major technology companies including Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and many others have famously risen to the top of the field despite not having bachelor’s degrees in CS. Yet, it is a fallacy to assume that these outliers are representative of most who are successful in the field. This misconception could lead observers to conclude that investments in universal CS education are, at best, ineffective: providing skills to people who would learn them on their own regardless, and spending resources on developing skills in people who will not use them. However, such conclusions are not supported by empirical evidence. Rather, across STEM disciplines, including CS, higher levels of training and educational attainment lead to stronger employment outcomes, on average, than those with lesser levels of training in the same fields (Altonji et al., 2016; Altonji and Zhong, 2021).\n",

      "The inequality argument\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Technology—and particularly unequal access to its benefits—has been a key driver of social and economic inequality within countries. That is, those with elite social status or higher wealth have historically gotten access to technology first for their private advantages, which tends to reinforce preexisting social and economic inequalities. Conversely, providing universal access to CS education and computing technologies can enable those with lower access to technological resources the opportunity to catch up and, consequently, mitigate these inequalities. Empirical studies have shown how technological skills or occupations, in particular, have reduced inequalities between groups or accelerated the assimilation of immigrants (Hanson and Slaughter, 2017; DeVol, 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Technology and CS education are likewise frequently considered critical in narrowing income gaps between developed and developing countries. This argument can be particularly compelling for low-income countries, as global development gaps will only be expected to widen if low-income countries’ investments in these domains falter while high-income countries continue to move ahead. Rather, strategic and intensive technological investment is frequently seen as a key strategy for less-developed countries to leapfrog stages of economic development to quickly catch up to more advanced countries (Fong, 2009; Lee, 2019).\n",

      "CS skills enable adaptation in a quickly changing world, and adaptability is critical to progress in society and the economy. Perhaps there is no better illustration of the ability to thrive and adapt than from the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has forced closures of many public spaces across the globe, though those closures’ impacts have been disproportionately felt across workers and sectors. Workers with the skills and abilities to move their job functions online have generally endured the pandemic more comfortably than those without those skills. And even more importantly, the organizations and private companies that had the human capacity to identify how technology could be utilized and applied to their operations could adapt in the face of the pandemic, while those without the resources to pivot their operations have frequently been forced to close in the wake of pandemic-induced restrictions. Thus, the pandemic bestowed comparative benefits on those with access to technology, the skills to use it, and the vision to recognize and implement novel applications quickly, while often punishing those with the least access and resources (OECD, 2021).\n",

      "Failing to invest in technology and CS education may result in constrained global competitiveness, leaving governments less able to support its citizens. We recognize that efforts to expand CS education will demand time and money of public officials and school leaders, often in the face of other worthy competing demands. Though the contemporary costs may even seem prohibitive in some cases, the costs of inaction (while less immediately visible) are also real and meaningful in most contexts.\n",

      "We expect the benefits of CS education to extend beyond economic motivations, as well. Many household activities that were previously performed in real life are now often performed digitally, ranging from banking, shopping, travel planning, and socializing. A functional knowledge of how computers work—beyond the simple use of applications—should benefit all students as they mature into adults given the increasing integration of technology into many aspects of daily life in the 21st century. For example, whether a person wants to find a job or a romantic partner, these activities frequently occur through the use of technology, and understanding how matching algorithms work make for more sophisticated technology users in the future. Familiarity with CS basic principles can provide users more flexibility in the face of constant innovation and make them less vulnerable to digital security threats or predators (Livingstone et al., 2011). Many school systems now provide lessons in online safety for children, and those lessons will presumably be more effective if children have a foundational understanding of how the internet works.\n",

We also reviewed the existing literature on integrating CS into K-12 education to gain a deeper understanding of the key barriers and challenges to expanding CS education globally.

Countries with mandatory CS education are geographically clustered in Eastern Europe and East Asia. Most states and provinces in the U.S. and Canada offer CS on a school-to-school basis or as an elective course. Multiple countries in Western Europe offer CS education as a cross-curricular topic integrated into other subjects. Latin America and Central and Southeast Asia have the most countries that have announced CS education programs or pilot projects. Countries in Africa and the Middle East have integrated the least amount of CS education into school curricula. Nevertheless, the number of countries piloting programs or adopting CS curricula indicate a global trend of more education systems integrating the subject into their curriculum.\n",

Additionally, high-income countries also offer CS as an elective course to the largest share of the population. A further 35 percent of high-income countries offer CS on a school-to-school basis while not making it mandatory for all schools. Interestingly, upper-middle income countries host the largest share of students (62 percent) who are required to learn CS at any point in primary or secondary schools. Presumably, many upper-middle income countries likely have national economic development strategies focused on expanding tech-related jobs, and thus see the need to expand the labor force with CS skills. By contrast, only 5 percent of lower-middle income countries require CS during primary or secondary school, while 58 percent may offer CS education on a school-to-school basis.\n",

      "To expand quality CS education, education systems must overcome enormous challenges. Many countries do not have enough teachers who are qualified to teach CS, and even though there is growing interest among students to pursue CS, relatively few students pursue more advanced training like CS testing certifications (Department for Education, 2019) or CS undergraduate majors compared to other STEM fields like engineering or biology (Hendrickson, 2019). This is especially true for girls and underrepresented minorities, who generally have fewer opportunities to develop an interest in CS and STEM more broadly (Code.org & CSTA, 2018). Our review of the literature identified four key challenges to expanding CS education.:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Providing access to ICT infrastructure to students and educators\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Student access to ICT infrastructure, including both personal access to computing devices and an internet connection, is critical to a robust CS education. Without this infrastructure, students cannot easily integrate CS skills into their daily lives, and they will have few opportunities to experiment with new approaches on their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, some initiatives have succeeded by introducing elements of CS education in settings without adequate ICT infrastructure. For example, many educators use alternative learning strategies like CS Unplugged to teach CS and computational thinking when computers are unavailable (Bell & Vahrenhold, 2018). One study shows that analog lessons can help primary school students develop computational thinking skills (Harris, 2018). Even without laptops or desktop computers, it is still possible for teachers to use digital tools for computational thinking. In South Africa, Professor Jean Greyling of Nelson Mandela University Computing Sciences co-created Tanks, a game that uses puzzle pieces and a mobile application to teach coding to children (Ellis, 2021). This is an especially useful concept, as many households and schools in South Africa and other developing countries have smartphones and access to analog materials but do not have access to personal computers or broadband connectivity (McCrocklin, 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking a full CS curriculum to scale, however, requires investing in adequate access to ICT infrastructure for educators and students (Lockwood & Cornell, 2013). Indeed, as discussed in Section 3, our analysis of numerous case studies indicates that ICT infrastructure in schools provides a critical foundation to expand CS education.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Ensuring qualified teachers through teacher preparation and professional development\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Many education systems encounter shortages of qualified CS teachers, contributing to a major bottleneck in CS expansion. A well-prepared and knowledgeable teacher is the most important component for instruction in commonly taught subjects (Chetty et al. 2014 a,b; Rivkin et al., 2005). We suspect this is no different for CS, though major deficiencies in the necessary CS skills among the teacher workforce are evident. For example, in a survey of preservice elementary school teachers in the United States, only 10 percent responded that they understood the concept of computational thinking (Campbell & Heller, 2019). Until six years ago, 75 percent of teachers in the U.S. incorrectly considered “creating documents or presentations on the computer” as a topic one would learn in a CS course (Google & Gallup, 2015), demonstrating a poor understanding of the distinction between CS and computer literacy. Other case studies, surveys, and interviews have found that teachers in India, Saudi Arabia, the U.K., and Turkey self-report low confidence in their understanding of CS (Ramen et al., 2015; Alfayez & Lambert, 2019; Royal Society, 2017; Gülbahar & Kalelioğlu, 2017). Indeed, developing the necessary skills and confidence levels for teachers to offer effective CS instruction remains challenging.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To address these challenges, school systems have introduced continuous professional development (PD), postgraduate certification programs, and CS credentials issued by teacher education degree programs. PD programs are common approaches, as they utilize the existing teacher workforce to fill the needs for special skills, rather than recruiting specialized teachers from outside the school system. For example, the British Computing Society created 10 regional university-based hubs to lead training activities, including lectures and meetings, to facilitate collaboration as part of the network of excellence (Dickens, 2016; Heintz et al., 2016; Royal Society, 2017). Most hubs involve multi-day seminars and workshops meant to familiarize teachers with CS concepts and provide ongoing support to help teachers as they encounter new challenges in the classroom. Cutts et al. (2017) further recommend teacher-led PD groups so that CS teachers can form collaborative professional networks. Various teacher surveys have found these PD programs in CS helpful (Alkaria & Alhassan, 2017; Goode et al., 2014). Still, more evidence is needed on the effectiveness of PD programs in CS education specifically (Hill, 2009).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Less commonly, some education systems have worked with teacher training institutions to introduce certification schemes so teachers can signal their unique qualifications in CS to employers. This signal can make teacher recruitment more transparent and incentivize more teachers to pursue training. This approach does require, though, an investment in developing CS education faculty at the teacher training institution, which may be a critical bottleneck in many places (Delyser et al., 2018). Advocates of the approach have recommended that school systems initiate certification schemes quickly and with a low bar at first, followed by improvement over time (Code.org, 2017; Lang et al., 2013; Sentance & Csizmadia, 2017). Short-term recommendations include giving temporary licenses to teachers who meet minimum content and knowledge requirements. Long-term recommendations, on the other hand, encourage preservice teachers to take CS courses as part of their teaching degree programs or in-service teachers to take CS courses as part of their graduate studies to augment their skillset.2 Upon completing these courses, teachers would earn a full CS endorsement or certificate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Fostering student engagement and interest in CS education\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Surveys from various countries suggest that despite a clear economic incentive, relatively few K-12 students express interest in pursuing advanced CS education. For example, 3 out of 4 U.S. students in a recent survey declared no interest in pursuing a career in computer science. And the differences by gender are notable: Nearly three times as many male students (33 percent) compared to female students (12 percent) expressed interest in pursuing a computer science career in the future (Google & Gallup, 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, parents view CS education favorably but also hold distinct misconceptions. For instance, more than 80 percent of U.S. parents surveyed in a Google and Gallup (2016) study reported that they think CS is as important as any other discipline. Nevertheless, the same parents indicated biases around who should take CS courses: 57 percent of parents think that one needs to be “very smart” to learn CS (Google & Gallup, 2015). Researchers have equated this kind of thinking to the idea that some people could be inherently gifted or inept at CS, a belief that could discourage some students from developing an interest or talent in CS (McCartney, 2017). Contrary to this belief, Patitsas et al. (2019) found that only 5.8 percent of university-level exam distributions were multimodal, indicating that most classes did not have a measurable divide between those who were inherently gifted and those who were not. This signals that CS is no more specialized to specific groups of students than any other subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Fostering student engagement, however, does not equate to developing a generation of programmers. Employment projections suggest the future demand for workers with CS skills will likely outpace supply in the absence of promoting students’ interest in the field. Yet, no countries expand access to CS education with the expectation of turning all students into computer programmers. Forcing students into career paths that are unnatural fits for their interests and skill levels result in worse outcomes for students at the decision margins (Kirkeboen et al., 2016). Rather, current engagement efforts both expose students to foundational skills that help navigate technology in 21st century life and provide opportunities for students to explore technical fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A lack of diversity in CS education not only excludes some people from accessing high-paying jobs, but it also reduces the number of students who would enter and succeed in the field (Du & Wimmer, 2019). Girls and racial minorities have been historically underrepresented in CS education (Sax et al., 2016). Research indicates that the diversity gap is not due to innate talent differences among demographic groups (Sullivan & Bers, 2012; Cussó-Calabuig et al., 2017), but rather a disparity of access to CS content (Google & Gallup 2016; Code.org & CSTA, 2018; Du & Wimmer, 2019), widely held cultural perceptions, and poor representation of women and underrepresented minorities (URMs) among industry leaders and in media depictions (Google & Gallup, 2015; Ayebi-Arthur, 2011; Downes & Looker, 2011).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To help meet the demand for CS professionals, government and philanthropic organizations have implemented programs that familiarize students with CS. By increasing student interest among K-12 students who may eventually pursue CS professions, these strategies have the potential to address the well documented lack of diversity in the tech industry (Harrison, 2019; Ioannou, 2018).For example, some have used short, one-time lessons in coding to reduce student anxiety around CS. Of these lessons, perhaps the best known is Hour of Code, designed by Code.org. In multiple surveys, students indicated more confidence after exposure to this program (Phillips & Brooks, 2017; Doukaki et al., 2013; Lang et al., 2016). It is not clear, however, whether these programs make students more likely to consider semester-long CS courses (Phillips & Brooks, 2017; Lang et al., 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Other initiatives create more time-intensive programs for students. The U.S. state of Georgia, for example, implemented a program involving after-school, weekend, and summer workshops over a six-year period. Georgia saw an increase in participation in the Advanced Placement (AP) CS exam during the duration of the program, especially among girls and URMs (Guzdial et al., 2014). Other states have offered similar programs, setting up summer camps and weekend workshops in universities to help high school students become familiar with CS (Best College Reviews, 2021). These initiatives, whether one-off introductions to CS or time-intensive programs, typically share the explicit goal of encouraging participation in CS education among all students, and especially girls and URMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, while studies indicate that Hour of Code and summer camps might improve student enthusiasm for CS, they do not provide the kind of rigorous impact assessment one would need to make a definitive conclusion of their effectiveness. They do not use a valid control group, meaning that there is no like-for-like comparison to students who are similar except for no exposure to the program. It is not clear that the increase in girls and URMs taking CS would not have happened if it were not for Georgia’s after-school clubs.\n",

Regional contexts, school infrastructure, prior access, and exposure to CS need to be considered when developing CS curricula and competencies (Ackovska et al., 2015). Some CS skills, such as programming language, require access to computer infrastructure that may be absent in some contexts (Lockwood & Cornell, 2013). Rather than prescribing a curriculum, the U.S. K-12 Computer Science Framework Steering Committee (2016) recommends foundational CS concepts and competencies for education systems to consider. This framework encourages curriculum developers and educators to create learning experiences that extend beyond the framework to encompass student interests and abilities.\n",

      "Several studies have described various methods for teaching CS core competencies. Integrated development environments are recommended especially for teaching coding skills (Florez et al., 2017; Saez-Lopez et al., 2016).2 These environments include block-based programming languages that encourage novice programmers to engage with programming, in part by alleviating the burden of syntax on learners (Weintrop & Wilensky, 2017; Repenning, 1993). Others recommended a variety of teaching methods that blend computerized lessons with offline activities (Taub et al. 2009; Curzon et al., 2009, Ackovska et al., 2015). This approach is meant to teach core concepts of computational thinking while keeping students engaged in physical, as well as digital, environments (Nishida et al., 2009). CS Unplugged, for example, provides kinesthetic lesson plans that include games and puzzles that teach core CS concepts like decomposition and algorithmic thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Various studies have also attempted to measure traditional lecture-based instruction for CS (Alhassan 2017; Cicek & Taspinar, 2016).3 These studies, however, rely on small sample sizes wherein the experiment and control group each comprised of individual classes. More rigorous research is required to understand the effectiveness of teaching strategies for CS.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No consensus has emerged on the best ways to assess student competency in core CS concepts (So et al., 2019; Djambong & Freiman, 2016). Though various approaches to assessment are widely available—including classical cognitive tests, standardized tests in digital environments, and CS Unplugged activity tests—too many countries have yet to introduce regular assessments that may evaluate various curricula or instructional methods in CS. While several assessments have been developed for CS and CT at various grade levels as part of various research studies, there have been challenges to broader use. This is due to either a lack of large-scale studies using these assessments or diversity in programming environments used to teach programming and CS or simply a lack of interest in using objective tests of learning (as opposed to student projects and portfolios).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, a growing number of organizations are developing standardized tests in CS and computational thinking. For example, the International Computer and Information Literacy Study included examinations in computational thinking in 2018 that had two 25-minute modules, where students were asked to develop a sequence of tasks in a program that related to a unified theme (Fraillon et al., 2020). The OECD’s PISA will also include questions in 2021 to assess computational thinking across countries (Schleicher & Partovi, 2019). The AP CS exam has also yielded useful comparisons that have indirectly evaluated CS teacher PD programs (Brown & Brown, 2019).\n",

      "In summary, the current evidence base provides little consensus on the specific means of scaling a high-quality CS education and leaves wide latitude for experimentation. Consequently, in this report we do not offer prescriptions on how to expand CS education, even while arguing that expanding access to it generally is beneficial for students and the societies that invest in it. Given the current (uneven) distribution of ICT infrastructure and CS education resources, high-quality CS education may be at odds with expanded access. While we focus on ensuring universal access first, it is important to recognize that as CS education scales both locally and globally, the issues of curricula, pedagogies, instructor quality, and evaluation naturally become more pressing.\n",

Its movement since 2015 is represented purely in the vertical policy action space, as it moved up four intervals on the index. Uruguay, conversely, started expanding its CS education program t a lower level both in terms of ICT infrastructure (x-axis) and existing CS policies (y-axis). Since starting CS expansion efforts in 2007, though, it has built a robust ICT infrastructure in its school systems and implemented 4 of 7 possible policy actions.\n",

      "Figure 6 suggests that first securing access to ICT infrastructure and broadband connectivity allows systems to dramatically improve access to and the quality of CS education. Examples include England, British Columbia, South Korea, and Arkansas. At the same time, Figure 6 suggests that systems that face the dual challenge of expanding ICT infrastructure and broadband connectivity and scaling the delivery of quality CS education, such as Chile, South Africa, Thailand, and Uruguay, may require more time and/or substantial investment to expand quality CS education to match the former cases. Even though Chile, Thailand, and especially Uruguay have made impressive progress since their CS education expansion efforts began, they continue to lag a few steps behind those countries that started with established ICT infrastructure in place.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In several of the case studies, economic development strategies were the underlying motivation to introduce or expand CS education. For example, Thailand’s 2017 20-year Strategic Plan marked the beginning of CS education in that country. The 72-page document, approved by the Thai Cabinet and Parliament, explained how Thailand could become a more “stable, prosperous, and sustainable” country and proposed to reform the education curriculum to prepare students for future labor demands (20-year National Strategy comes into effect, 2018). Similarly, Arkansas’s Governor Hutchinson made CS education a key part of his first campaign in 2014 (CS for All, n.d.), stating that “Through encouraging computer science and technology as a meaningful career path, we will produce more graduates prepared for the information-based economy that represents a wide-open job market for our young people” (Arkansas Department of Education, 2019).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Uruguay’s Plan Ceibal, named after the country’s national flowering tree, was likewise introduced in 2007 as a presidential initiative to incorporate technology in education and help close a gaping digital divide in the country. The initiative’s main objectives were to promote digital inclusion, graduate employability, a national digital culture, higher-order thinking skills, gender equity, and student motivation (Jara, Hepp, & Rodriguez, 2018)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Last, in 2018, the European Commission issued the Digital Education Action Plan that enumerated key digital skills for European citizens and students, including CS and computational thinking (European Commission, 2018). The plan encouraged young Europeans to understand the algorithms that underpin the technologies they use on a regular basis. In response to the plan, Italy’s 2018 National Indications and New Scenarios report included a discussion on the importance of computational thinking and the potential role of educational gaming and robotics in enhancing learning outcomes (Giacalone, 2019). Then, in 2019, the Italian Ministry of Education and the Parliament approved a legislative motion to include CS and computational thinking in primary school curricula by 2022 (Orizzontescuola, 2019).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, the impetus to expand CS education came more directly from demands from key stakeholders, including industry and parents. For example, British Columbia’s CS education program traces back to calls from a growing technology industry (Doucette, 2016). In 2016, the province’s technology sector employed 86,000 people—more than the mining, forestry, and oil and gas sectors combined, with high growth projections (Silcoff, 2016). The same year, leaders of the province’s technology companies revealed in interviews that access to talent had become their biggest concern (KPMG, 2016). According to a 2016 B.C. Technology Association report, the province needed 12,500 more graduates in CS from tertiary institutions between 2015 and 2021 to fill unmet demand in the labor market (Orton, 2018). The economic justification for improving CS education in the province was clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Growing parental demand helped create the impetus for changes to the CS curriculum in Poland. According to Kozlowski (2016), Polish parents perceive CS professions as some of the most desirable options for their children. And given the lack of options for CS education in schools, parents often seek out extracurricular workshops for their children to encourage them to develop their CS skills (Panskyi, Rowinska, & Biedron, 2019). The lack of in-school CS options for students created the push for curricular reforms to expand CS in primary and secondary schools. As former Minister of Education Anna Zalewska declared, Polish students “cannot afford to waste time on [the] slow, arduous task of building digital skills outside school [ and] only school education can offer systematic teaching of digital skills” (Szymański, 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. ICT in schools provides the foundation to expand CS education\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous efforts to expand access to devices, connectivity, or basic computer literacy in schools provided a starting point in several jurisdictions to expand CS education. For example, the Uruguayan government built its CS education program after implementing expansive one-to-one computing projects, which made CS education affordable and accessible. In England, an ICT course was implemented in schools in the mid-1990s. These dedicated hours during the school day for ICT facilitated the expansion of CS education in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chilean Enlaces program, developed in 1992 as a network of 24 universities, technology companies, and other organizations (Jara, Hepp, & Rodriguez, 2018; Sánchez & Salinas, 2008) sought to equip schools with digital tools and train teachers in their use (Severin, 2016). It provided internet connectivity and digital devices that enabled ICT education to take place in virtually all of Chile’s 10,000 public and subsidized private schools by 2008 (Santiago, Fiszbein, Jaramillo, & Radinger, 2017; Severin et al., 2016). Though Enlaces yielded few observable effects on classroom learning or ICT competencies (Sánchez & Salinas, 2008), the program provided the infrastructure needed to begin CS education initiatives years later.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While a history of ICT expansion can serve as a base for CS education, institutional flexibility to transform traditional ICT projects into CS education is crucial. The Chilean Enlaces program’s broader institutional reach resulted in a larger bureaucracy, slower implementation of new programs, and greater dependence on high-level political agendas (Severin, 2016). As a result, the program’s inflexibility prevented it from taking on new projects, placing the onus on the Ministry of Education to take the lead in initiating CS education. In Uruguay, Plan Ceibal’s initial top-down organizational structure enabled relatively fast implementation of the One Laptop per Child program, but closer coordination with educators and education authorities may have helped to better integrate education technology into teaching and learning. More recently, Plan Ceibal has involved teachers and school leaders more closely when introducing CS activities. In England, the transition from ICT courses to a computing curriculum that prioritized CS concepts, instead of computer literacy topics that the ICT teachers typically emphasized before the change, encountered some resistance. Many former ICT teachers were not prepared to implement the new program of study as intended, which leads us to the next key lesson.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Developing qualified teachers for CS education should be a top priority\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The case studies highlight the critical need to invest in training adequate numbers of teachers to bring CS education to scale. For example, England took a modest approach to teacher training during the first five years of expanding its CS education K-12 program and discovered that its strategy fell short of its original ambitions. In 2013, the English Department for Education (DfE) funded the BCS to establish and run the Network of Excellence to create learning hubs and train a pool of “master” CS teachers. While over 500 master teachers were trained, the numbers were insufficient to expand CS education at scale. Then, in 2018 the DfE substantially increased its funding to establish the National Center for Computing Education (NCCE) and added 23 new computing hubs throughout England. Hubs offer support to primary and secondary computing teachers in their designated areas, including teaching, resources, and PD (Snowdon, 2019). In just over two years, England has come a long way toward fulfilling its goals of training teachers at scale with over 29,500 teachers engaged in some type of training (Teach Computing, 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Several education systems partnered with higher education institutions to integrate CS education in both preservice and in-service teacher education programs. For example, two main institutions in British Columbia, Canada—the University of British Columbia and the University of Northern British Columbia—now offer CS courses in their pre-service teacher education programs. Similarly, in Poland, the Ministry of National Education sponsored teacher training courses in university CS departments. In Arkansas, state universities offer CS certification as part of preservice teacher training while partnering with the Arkansas Department of Education to host in-service professional development.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Still other systems partnered with nonprofit organizations to deliver teacher education programs. For instance, New Brunswick, Canada, partnered with the nonprofit organization Brilliant Labs to implement teacher PD programs in CS (Brilliant Labs, n.d.). In Chile, the Ministry of Education partnered with several nongovernmental organizations, including Code.org and Fundación Telefónica, to expand teacher training in CS education. Microsoft Philanthropies launched the Technology Education and Literacy in Schools (TEALS) in the United States and Canada to connect high school teachers to technology industry volunteers. The volunteer experts support instructors to learn CS independently over time and develop sustainable high school CS programs (Microsoft, n.d.).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To encourage teachers to participate in these training programs, several systems introduced teacher certification pathways in CS education. For example, in British Columbia, teachers need at least 24 credits of postsecondary coursework in CS education to be qualified to work in public schools. The Arkansas Department of Education incentivizes in-service teachers to attain certification through teaching CS courses and participating in approved PD programs (Code.org, CSTA, ECEP, 2019). In South Korea, where the teaching profession is highly selective and enjoys high social status, teachers receive comprehensive training on high-skill computational thinking elements, such as computer architecture, operating systems, programming, algorithms, networking, and multimedia. Only after receiving the “informatics–computer” teacher’s license may a teacher apply for the informatics teacher recruitment exam (Choi et al., 2015).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When faced with shortages of qualified teachers, remote instruction can provide greater access to qualified teachers. For example, a dearth of qualified CS teachers has been and continues to be a challenge for Uruguay. To address this challenge, in 2017, Plan Ceibal began providing remote instruction in computational thinking lessons for public school fifth and sixth graders and integrated fourth-grade students a year later. Students work on thematic projects anchored in a curricular context where instructors integrate tools like Scratch.4 During the school year, a group of students in a class can work on three to four projects during a weekly 45-minute videoconference with a remote instructor, while another group can work on projects for the same duration led by the classroom teacher. In a typical week, the remote instructor introduces an aspect of computational thinking. The in-class teacher then facilitates activities like block-based programming, circuit board examination, or other exercises prescribed by the remote teacher (Cobo & Montaldo, 2018).5 Importantly, Plan Ceibal implements Pensamiento Computacional, providing a remote instructor and videoconferencing devices at the request of schools, rather than imposing the curriculum on all classrooms (García, 2020). With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic forcing many school systems across the globe to adopt remote instruction, at least temporarily, we speculate that remote learning is now well poised to become more common in expanding CS education in places facing ongoing teacher shortages.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. Exposing students to CS education early helps foster demand, especially among underserved populations\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Most education systems have underserved populations who lack the opportunity to develop an interest in CS, limiting opportunities later in life. For example, low CS enrollment rates for women at Italian universities reflect the gender gap in CS education. As of 2017, 21.6 percent and 12.3 percent of students completing bachelor’s degrees in information engineering and CS, respectively, were women (Marzolla, 2019). Further, female professors and researchers in these two subjects are also underrepresented. In 2018, only 15 percent and 24 percent of professors and researchers in CS and computer engineering, respectively, were women (Marzolla, 2019). Similar representation gaps at the highest levels of CS training are common globally. Thus, continuing to offer exposure to CS only in post-secondary education will likely perpetuate similar representation gaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this challenge, several education systems have implemented programs to make CS education accessible to girls and other underserved populations in early grades, before secondary school. For instance, to make CS education more gender balanced, the Italian Ministry of Education partnered with civil society organizations to implement programs to spur girls’ interest in CS and encourage them to specialize in the subject later (European Commission, 2009). An Italian employment agency (ironically named Men at Work) launched a project called Girls Code It Better to extend CS learning opportunities to 1,413 middle school girls across 53 schools in 2019 (Girls Code It Better, n.d.). During the academic year, the girls attended extracurricular CS courses before developing their own technologically advanced products and showcasing their work at an event at Bocconi University in Milan (Brogi, 2019). In addition to introducing the participants to CS, the initiative provided the girls with role models and generated awareness on the gender gap in CS education in Italy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In British Columbia, students are exposed to computational thinking concepts as early as primary school, where they learn how to prototype, share, and test ideas. In the early grades of primary education, the British Columbia curriculum emphasizes numeracy using technology and information technology. Students develop numeracy skills by using models and learn information technology skills to apply across subjects. In kindergarten and first grade, curricular objectives include preparing students for presenting ideas using electronic documents. In grades 2 to 3, the curricular goals specify that students should “demonstrate an awareness of ways in which people communicate, including the use of technology,” in English language arts classes, as well as find information using information technology tools. By the time students are in grades 4 and 5, the curriculum expects students to focus more on prototyping and testing new ideas to solve a problem (Gannon & Buteau, 2018).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Several systems have also increased participation in CS education by integrating it as a cross-curricular subject. This approach avoids the need to find time during an already-packed school day to teach CS as a standalone subject. For example, in 2015, the Arkansas legislature began requiring elementary and middle school teachers to embed computational thinking concepts in other academic courses. As a result, teachers in the state integrate five main concepts of computational thinking into their lesson plans, including (1) problem-solving, (2) data and information, (3) algorithms and programs, (4) computers and communications, and, importantly, (5) community, global, and ethical impacts (Watson-Fisher, 2019). In the years following this reform, the share of African American students taking CS in high school reached 19.6 percent, a figure that slightly exceeds the percentage of African Americans among all students—a resounding sign of progress in creating student demand for CS education (Computer science on the rise in Arkansas schools, Gov. drafts legislation to make it a requirement for graduation, 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After-school programs and summer camps, jointly organized with external partners, have also helped promote demand for CS education through targeted outreach programs to commonly underserved populations. For example, Microsoft Thailand has been holding free coding classes, Hour of Code, in partnership with nonprofit organizations, to encourage children from underprivileged backgrounds to pursue STEM education (Microsoft celebrates Hour of Code to build future ready generations in Asia, 2017). In the past decade, Microsoft has extended opportunities for ICT and digital skills development to more than 800,000 youth from diverse backgrounds—including those with disabilities and residents of remote communities (Thongnab, 2019). Their annual #MakeWhatsNext event for young Thai women showcases STEM careers and the growing demand for those careers (Making coding fun for Thailand’s young, 2018). Also in Thailand, Redemptorist Foundation for People with Disabilities, with over 30 years of experience working with differently abled communities in that country, expanded their services to offer computer trainings and information technology vocational certificate programs for differently abled youth (Mahatai, n.d.).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In British Columbia, Canada, the Ministry of Education and other stakeholders have taken steps to give girls, women, and aboriginal students the opportunity to develop an interest in CS education.For example, after-school programs have taken specific steps to increase girls’ participation in CS education. The UBC Department of Computer Science runs GIRLsmarts4tech, a program that focuses on giving 7th- grade girls role models and mentors that encourage them to pursue technology-related interests (GIRLsmarts4tech, n.d.). According to the latest census, in 2016, British Columbia’s First Nations and Indigenous Peoples (FNIP) population—including First Nations, Metis, and Inuits—was 270,585, an increase of 38 percent from 2006. With 42.5 percent of the FNIP population under 25, it is critical for the province to deliver quality education to this young and growing group (Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training, 2018). To this end, part of the British Columbia curriculum for CS education incorporates FNIP world views, perspectives, knowledge, and practices in CS concepts. In addition, the B.C. based ANCESTOR project (AborigiNal Computer Education through STORytelling) has organized courses and workshops to encourage FNIP students to develop computer games or animated stories related to their culture and land (Westor & Binn, 2015).\n",

      "5. Engaging key stakeholders can help address bottlenecks\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In most reviewed cases, the private sector and nongovernmental organizations played a role in promoting the expansion of CS education. Technology companies not only helped to lobby for expanding CS education, but often provided much-needed infrastructure and subject matter expertise in the design and rollout of CS education. For example, Microsoft Thailand has worked with the Thai government since 1998 in various capacities, including contributing to the development and implementation of coding projects, digital skills initiatives, teacher training programs, and online learning platforms (Thongnab, 2019; Coding Thailand, n.d.). Since 2002, Intel’s Teach Thailand program has trained more than 150,000 teachers. Additionally, Google Coding Teacher workshops train educators on teaching computational thinking through CS Unplugged coding activities (EduTech Thailand, 2019). The workshop is conducted by Edutech (Thailand) Co., Ltd., an educational partner of Google, which adapted the Google curriculum to the Thailand education context. Samsung has been engaged in a smart classroom project that has built futuristic classroom prototypes and provided training for 21st century competencies (OECD/UNESCO, 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In England, nongovernmental organizations have played an important role in supporting the government’s expansion of CS education. The DfE has relied on outside organizations for help in executing its CS education responsibilities. The DfE’s NCEE, for instance, is delivered by a consortium including the British Computing Society, STEM Learning, and the Raspberry Pi Foundation—three nonprofit organizations dedicated to advancing the computing industry and CS education in the country (British Computing Society, n.d; STEM Learning, n.d.; Raspberry Pi Foundation, n.d.).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chile’s Ministry of Education developed partnerships with individual NGOs and private companies to engage more students, especially girls. These initiatives offer the opportunity for hands-on learning projects and programming activities that students can perform from their home computers. Some of the same partners also provide online training platforms for teacher PD.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Industry advocacy organizations can also play an important role in the expansion of CS education. For example, in Arkansas, the state’s business community has long supported CS education (Nix, 2017). Accelerate Arkansas was established in 2005 as an organization of 70 private and public sector members dedicated to moving Arkansas into a more innovation- and knowledge-based economy (State of Arkansas, 2018). Similarly, in England, a network of organizations called Computing at School established a coalition of industry representatives and teachers. It played a pivotal role in rebranding the ICT education program in 2014 to the computing program that placed a greater emphasis on CS (Royal Society, 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure sustainability, one key lesson is that the government should coordinate across multiple stakeholders. The reliance on inputs from external organizations to drive CS education implies that the heavy reliance on NGO-provided training and resources in Chile have been insufficient to motivate more schools and teachers to include CS and computational thinking in classroom learning activities. By contrast, the DfE has effectively coordinated across various nongovernmental organizations to expand CS education. Similarly, Arkansas’s Department of Education is leading an effort to get half of all school districts to form partnerships with universities and business organizations to give students opportunities to participate internships and college-level CS courses while in high school (Talk Business & Politics, 2020). In sum, the experience of decades of educational policies across the education systems reviewed shows that schools require long lasting, coordinated, and multidimensional support to achieve successful implementation of CS in classrooms.\n",

      "\n",
      "Several of the cases studied introduced innovative pedagogies using makerspaces (learning spaces with customizable layouts and materials) and project-based learning to develop not only skills specific to CS but also skills that are relevant more broadly for life. For example, Uruguayan CS education features innovative concepts like robotics competitions and makerspaces that allow students to creatively apply their computational thinking lessons and that can spark interest and deepen understanding. In addition, computational thinking has been integrated across subject areas (e.g., in biology, math, and statistics) (Vázquez et al., 2019) and in interdisciplinary projects that immerse students in imaginative challenges that foster creative, challenging, and active learning (Cobo & Montaldo, 2018). For instance, students can use sensors and program circuit boards to measure their own progress in physical education (e.g., measuring how many laps they can run in a given period).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, in New Brunswick, Brilliant Labs provide learning materials to schools so they can offer students CS lessons using makerspaces that encourage students to develop projects, engage with technology, learn, and collaborate. These makerspaces enable students to creatively apply their CS and computational thinking lessons, sparking interest and deepening understanding of CS and computational thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thailand’s curricular reforms also integrated project-based learning into CS education. Thai students in grades 4-6 learn about daily life through computers, including skills such as using logic in problem-solving, searching data and assessing its correctness, and block coding (e.g., Scratch). Then, students in grades 7-9 focus on learning about primary data through objectives that include using programming to solve problems, collecting, analyzing, presenting, and assessing data and information, and textual programming such as Python. Finally, students in grades 10-12 focus on applying advanced computing technology and programming to solve real-world problems, using knowledge from other subjects and data from external sources (Piamsa-nga et al., 2020).\n",

      "After two years of nationwide discussions from 2014 to 2016, the Polish Ministry of National Education announced the creation of a new core curriculum for CS in primary and secondary schools (Syslo, 2020).

      "CS skills are increasingly necessary to function in today’s technology-advanced world and for the future. They enable individuals to understand how technology works, and how best to harness its potential to improve lives. As these skills take preeminence in the rapidly changing 21st century, CS education promises to significantly enhance student preparedness for the future of work and active citizenship.\n",

      "\n",
      "Our findings suggest six recommendations for governments interested in taking CS education to scale in primary and secondary schools. First, governments should use economic development strategies focused on expanding technology-based jobs to engage all stakeholders and expand CS education in primary and secondary schools. Indeed, such a strategy helps attract and retain investors and foster CS education demand among students. Second, provide access to ICT infrastructure in primary and secondary schools to facilitate the introduction and expansion of CS education. Third, developing qualified teachers for CS should be a top priority. The evidence is clear that a qualified teacher is the most important factor in student learning, and thus preparing the teacher force needed for CS at scale is crucial. Fourth, expose students early to CS education to increase their likelihood of pursuing it. This is especially important for girls and other URM groups historically underrepresented in STEM and CS fields. Fifth, engage key stakeholders (including educators, the private sector, and civil society) to help address bottlenecks in physical and technical capacity. Finally, teach CS in an interactive, hands-on way to build skills for life.\n",

      "The Pentagon’s top researchers have rushed a classified and controversial intelligence program into Afghanistan. Known as “Nexus 7,” and previously undisclosed as a war-zone surveillance effort, it ties together everything from spy radars to fruit prices in order to glean clues about Afghan instability.\n",
      "The program has been pushed hard by the leadership of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). They see Nexus 7 as both a breakthrough data-analysis tool and an opportunity to move beyond its traditional, long-range research role and into a more active wartime mission. \n",
      "But those efforts are drawing fire from some frontline intel operators who see Nexus 7 as little more than a glorified grad-school project, wasting tens of millions on duplicative technology that has nothing to do with stopping the Taliban. \n",
      "“There are no models and there are no algorithms,” says one person familiar with the program, echoing numerous others who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the program publicly. Just “200 lines of buggy Python code to do what imagery analysts do every day.” \n",

      "URL: The New Urban Demographics: Race Space & Boomer Aging\n",
      "TITLE: \n",
      "America’s urban landscape is changing. The familiar distinctions between central cities and suburbs and between the growing Sunbelt and the more stagnant Frostbelt parts of the country are being complicated by new demographic trends, two in particular. The first trend is the sharp rise in immigration to the United States. Each year about one million people, predominantly Latin American and Asian in origin, arrive in the United States, most settling in urban areas. The second trend involves the baby-boomers. This large cohort of 76 million people?often termed “the pig in the python”?is now aging toward the tail of that python. Most boomers will not move but “age in place”?in the suburbs rather than in the city. Both these trends will have important effects on urban America.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the “White-Black, City-Suburb” Typology \n",
      "For much of the postwar period, discussions of race and space in urban America revolved around black migration to central cities and “white flight” to the suburbs. The new immigration that is infusing many urban areas with new residents from a variety of backgrounds suggests the need for a new way of thinking about the demographic profiles of cities and suburbs.\n",
      "The impact of immigration is apparent from a glance at the central counties (those that contain a metropolitan area’s central-city population) showing greatest population gains during 1990?99. The two largest gainers, Maricopa County, home of Phoenix, and Clark County, home of Las Vegas, achieved most of their gains from domestic migration?migrants from other parts of the United States. Yet each of the next five central counties with the greatest population gains?those of the Los Angeles, Houston, San Diego, Miami, and Dallas metropolitan areas?registered a net loss of domestic migrants. Their gains came entirely from international migration and natural increase. Were it not for immigration, the population of these areas, and of several other large central counties, would register far smaller growth or outright declines. Indeed, areas that do not attract nearly as many immigrants?the central counties of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Cleveland, and Buffalo, among others?lost population over the 1990s.\n",
      "Because conventional city-suburb, black-white demographic profiles do not take adequate account of this new immigration, I offer a new typology of the nation’s large metropolitan areas, those with populations greater than 1 million (see table 1).\n",

      "The typology begins with a Multiethnic High Immigration category of 12 metropolitan areas with high immigration and a significant Asian or Hispanic presence. The largest of these areas are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. Four other categories cover areas that have a primarily black minority presence and those that are mostly white; and within each, those growing at a relatively high pace and those growing only modestly. These four categories are: White-Black Fast-Growing (for example, Atlanta), White-Black Slow-Growing (Detroit), Mostly White Fast-Growing (Las Vegas), and Mostly White Slow-Growing (Pittsburgh).\n",
      "In metropolitan areas where white-black racial dynamics have been a historically important demographic dimension, the slow-growing areas tend to be in the Rustbelt (New Orleans being an exception), and the fast-growing areas are located in the Southeast, which has now begun to attract back significant numbers of African Americans. Mostly White Fast-Growing areas are located primarily in the West and Midwest (Orlando, Nashville, and West Palm Beach excepted). Mostly White Slow-Growing areas are located in the Northeast and Midwest (Louisville excepted).\n",

      "Table 2 gives the composite racial profiles for cities and suburbs in each of these five categories. Multiethnic High Immigration areas clearly have the greatest diversity both in their cities and in their suburbs although the suburbs remain majority white. Among the White-Black categories, the slow-growing areas show a lesser tendency toward black suburbanization.\n",
      "What these statistics show is that the conventional view of cities as being in decline and as having predominantly black populations fails to take into account recent changes in the urban scene. Today some of the nation’s fastest-growing cities are gaining population from domestic migration and are mostly white. And several large multiethnic metropolitan areas house “majority minorities” in their cities and may soon do so in their suburbs as well.\n",
      "The old “city-suburb” typology also fails to recognize heterogeneous growth patterns within the suburbs. Many inner and even middle suburbs are experiencing demographic dynamics similar to those of the cities. This is especially the case in some of the largest “melting pot” metropolitan areas. A look at the immigration and domestic migration dynamics for counties within the greater Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York CMSAs (Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas) shows that it is not just the inner counties whose gains are attributable solely to international migration. Of the 29 counties in the greater New York CMSA, fully 20 registered negative domestic migration during 1990?99 and achieved their only migration growth from immigration from abroad. The same goes for 4 of the 5 counties in the Los Angeles CMSA and for 7 of the 10 counties of the San Francisco CMSA.\n",
      "The heterogeneity of suburbs was already apparent in 1990. Figure 1 compares the Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Detroit metropolitan areas. The racially diverse suburbs of Los Angeles, with their infusion of immigrants and new ethnic minorities, contrast with the suburbs of Atlanta, which show moderate racial heterogeneity, and those of slower-growing Detroit, where historical racial antagonisms keep the divide between city and suburbs fairly sharp.\n",
      "Suburban growth patterns continue to favor the outer suburbs. Of the 30 counties that made the fastest gains via net domestic migration during 1990?99, most that are in metropolitan areas lie in the outer suburban reaches of fast-growing metropolitan areas such as Denver, Atlanta, Las Vegas, Dallas, and Houston. Even in the fast-growing, less dense portions of the country, an outer suburban residence remains popular.\n",
      "Aging Boomers, Cities, and Suburbs\n",
      "Since the baby-boom generation began entering grade school in the 1950s, it has been followed closely by marketers, policymakers, and political consultants. But the boomers’ sharp disengagement from the residential aspects of city life seems to have escaped the notice of urban watchers.\n",
      "The aging of the nation’s first suburban generation will increase substantially the number of households in their 50s and early 60s over the next 10 years. Early boomers?born between 1945 and 1955?will be making the transition from empty-nesters to preretirees. Many will retire from regular jobs. Some will leave their suburban homes. But most will “age in place” or perhaps make a local move.\n",
      "The late boomers?those born between 1955 and 1964?will still be in their prime career and prime earnings ages. Some will be looking to upgrade their housing, again in the same local area. They will have fewer children living at home than did earlier generations at the same age?and therefore more freedom in their location decisions.\n",
      "Some observers have expressed the hope that these huge boomer generations might be a source for central-city revival. But the hope seems unrealistic, given the current location of this “suburban generation.” With the exception of Hispanics, baby-boomers, now in the 35-54 age groups, are less likely to reside in the city than either today’s elderly or adults now in their 20s and early 30s.\n",
      "In fact, elderly growth patterns during the 1990s show that the “graying of the suburbs” is well under way. Of the 30 counties with fastest-gaining elderly populations over the 1990s, most are either in nonmetropolitan areas or in middle or outer suburban counties of fast-growing metropolitan areas. Much of this simply reflects the aging-in-place of elderly who have moved to these fast-growing metropolitan areas during their lifetimes.\n",
      "The projected gains in elderly over the next 25 years will occur in the Mostly White Fast-Growing and White-Black Fast-Growing areas discussed earlier. While some of this growth will be attributable to retirement migration to high amenity areas of the Mountain West and South, most will result from the aging-in-place of boomers who relocated there during their working lives or at least before retirement.\n",
      "This suggests somewhat different patterns of growth for the new immigrant minorities than for largely white or white and black baby-boomers. Much of the boomer growth and, hence, the projected elderly gains will be in the suburbs of major metropolitan areas and in regions of the country that are not capturing new immigrant minorities. Within metropolitan areas the better-off and healthy “yuppie elderly” will tend to locate on the periphery, and the more disadvantaged segments of the older population will reside closer in.\n",
      "Central cities and inner suburbs in metropolitan regions that have suffered economic and demographic declines in recent decades will continue to house disproportionate numbers of the nation’s disadvantaged elderly?older elderly people, widows and widowers, female-headed households, those with incomes below or near the poverty level and relatively high levels of disability. As they continue to age in place, they will pose special challenges for local institutions that are often the most financially strapped.\n",
      "But although the aging of the baby-boomers will have different effects for cities and suburbs, dealing with the social services, health care, and transportation needs of a faster-growing senior population will prove a challenge to cities and suburbs alike.\n",
      "New Forces at Work\n",
      "The advent of new immigrants and the aging of the baby-boomers will surely complicate both urban and suburban race-ethnic and aging demographic dynamics.\n",
      "The demographics of Los Angeles provide just one example of how the two countervailing trends could operate. As a result of the successive outmigration of whites, juxtaposed with the continued waves of immigration of new ethnic minorities, Los Angeles County’s elderly population is still majority white, its working-aged population is only about one-third white, and its child population is predominantly Hispanic and other racial and ethnic groups. Reflecting their age, the growing racial and ethnic groups in Los Angeles will be concerned with issues of affordable housing, good schools, and neighborhoods conducive to the raising of children. And, reflecting their age, whites are likely to be more concerned with health and social support services for an aging dependent population. Whether the same kind of “racial generation gap” will occur in other melting pot metropolitan areas remains to be seen.\n",
      "Whatever else the new urban population profiles show, the old models of dealing with cities and suburbs will need to be revised to adapt to new demographic forces in America today.\n",

      "TITLE: \n",
      "While the world is fixated on Iraq and the Middle East, North Korea continues to pose at least as great a threat to Western security interests. Six-party talks with the North Koreans in Beijing have just showed that the Bush administration hasn’t yet found a way out of the nuclear crisis. Although negotiations appear likely to resume in a couple of months, their prospects for success seem poor.\n",
      "The basic dilemma is easy to understand. North Korea will not surrender its nuclear capabilities, which are among its only valuable national assets, unless offered a very good deal for giving them up. President Bush refuses to offer such a deal because he sees the North Korean demand as blackmail. He insists that before any talks about better diplomatic relations or economic interaction occur, North Korea first relinquish—with verification—a nuclear program it had pledged nine years ago to abandon completely. At most, Bush may, as an interim gesture, offer to sign a multilateral accord in which all six parties (the two Koreas, the United States, China, Japan and Russia) pledge not to attack each other.\n",
      "Meanwhile, in fits and starts North Korea continues its gradual progress toward a larger nuclear capability. Given the regime’s desperate economic straits, its erratic and eccentric and isolated regime and its threats last April that it might even export nuclear materials if circumstances got bad enough, this is extremely bad news.\n",
      "To the extent the Bush administration has a plan for addressing this crisis, it is a strategy of pressure. It insisted on the six-party negotiating format because that allows the other five parties all to insist that North Korea de-nuclearize. That kind of setting also deprives North Korea of its bluster and brinkmanship tactics.\n",

      "For example, when the delegation from Pyongyang used the recent Beijing meeting to accuse the Bush administration of harboring aggressive designs on North Korea, Russia countered that it was confident the United States had no such intention. The Bush administration also has established a creative concept known as the proliferation security initiative, by which countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia, France and Germany make use of existing national laws to inspect North Korean ships in their waters—complicating North Korea’s efforts to smuggle illicit weapons, drugs and counterfeit currency.\n",
      "And the military card is still on the table in principle as well.\n",
      "But the Bush administration’s strategy is unlikely to work. Faced with gradual economic strangulation, North Korea’s stubborn and spiteful regime would probably again let its people starve—and perhaps consider selling dangerous weapons to terrorists—before crying uncle. Moreover, China, South Korea and Japan are far from ready to apply such a “python strategy.” China publicly criticized the United States for having an inflexible stance in last month’s talks.\n",

      "Japan and South Korea both insisted on presenting a more conciliatory package of incentives to North Korea in Beijing than Washington was prepared to countenance. And none of our three key regional partners has any interest whatever in a military option at this point.\n",
      "Faced with this dilemma, we need to think bigger. We must offer much more to North Korea but demand far more in return. The goal should be to push North Korea, which has shown increasing interest in economic reform, to seriously attempt such reform—building on the precedents offered by China and Vietnam in the past two decades. If North Korea is willing and takes steps, such as cutting its conventional military forces, that are needed to give such a plan any hope of success, we can be generous in return. This would not be giving in to blackmail; it would be a form of assisted suicide for the Stalinist ways of the North Korean regime. Even if Kim Jong Il and his cronies survived the transition, their rule would be radically transformed.\n",
      "This plan would require the help of all six parties that are now part of the negotiating process. Chinese economists and technicians would teach the North Koreans how to carry out market reforms. Russia would reassure Kim Jong Il and his military commanders that intrusive arms control verification can be done without opening up the country to attack. Japan and South Korea would provide aid and investment; South Korea would also have to make at least modest cuts in its conventional forces in return for much deeper cuts in the oversized North Korean military.\n",
      "Beyond the nuclear and conventional military issues, North Korea would also agree to verifiable elimination of its chemical weapons and ballistic missiles. It would cease counterfeiting and drug trafficking. It would have to let all Japanese kidnapping victims leave and begin a human rights dialogue with the outside world. It would continue to abstain from terrorism and provocative actions against its neighbors.\n",
      "The United States would, for its part, ease trade sanctions immediately and ultimately lift them. It would, together with its regional partners and international financial institutions, provide at least $2 billion a year in aid to North Korea. The aid would not be in the form of cash (or new nuclear reactors), and would not be provided in one big dose but would be disbursed incrementally—while we watched to make sure North Korea was also holding up its end of the grand bargain.\n",
      "Diplomatic ties and security assurances leading to a full peace treaty would also be appropriate.\n",
      "Of course, this approach might well fail. North Korean leaders may, for example, believe they need nuclear weapons to deter the Bush administration from another preemptive action against another charter member of the axis of evil. But it would be a major mistake to act on that assumption before testing it. And if we try and fail, coercive policies may then become possible, as our regional partners will have a much harder time claiming that diplomacy has not yet been seriously attempted.\n",

      "As fears about the coronavirus increased early last year, Asian Americans—and especially Asian American women—began to sound the alarm about a rise in anti-Asian violence, harassment, and hate. Asian Americans have been stabbed, beaten, pushed, spit on, harassed, and vilified based on the false assumption that they were to blame for the origin and spread of COVID-19.\n",

      "The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act emerged from the lesser known 1875 Page Act, which prohibited the entry of unfree laborers, prostitutes, and women who were brought for “lewd and immoral purposes.” Proposed by Horace F. Page—a Republican congressman from California who exemplified his party’s stance toward Chinese women in the mid-1870s—the bill aimed to send “the brazen harlot who openly flaunts her wickedness in the faces of our wives and daughters back to her native country.” Page linked ethnicity and gender to disease and immorality in order to justify his argument for Chinese exclusion. Chinese women were characterized as “the most undesirable of population, who spread disease and moral death among our white population,” according to California Sen. Cornelius Cole.\n",
      "Science and medicine were critical to the medical and moral scapegoating of Chinese women who were deemed invariably to be prostitutes. In his role as president of the American Medical Association in 1876, J. Marion Sims warned that syphilis had reached epidemic proportions in San Francisco because of the cheap sexual favors doled out by Chinese prostitutes to white men—and alarmingly, to white boys as young as eight.\n",
      "Sims drew on the testimony of Dr. Hugh H. Toland who testified before the San Francisco legislature that Chinese prostitutes were spreading a unique strain of syphilis that failed to respond to therapy and proved deadly for his white patients. Toland claimed, “There is scarcely a single day that there are not a dozen young men come to my office with syphilis or gonorrhea… in nine cases out of ten it is the ruin of them,” adding that the “whole system becomes poisoned and debilitated.”\n",
      "Apart from the medical threat, Toland underscored the moral threat posed by Chinese prostitutes to young, white boys:\n",
      "“I have seen boys eight and ten years old with diseases they told me they contracted on Jackson Street. It is astonishing how soon they commence in indulging in that passion… I am satisfied, from my experience, that nearly all the boys in town, who have venereal disease, contracted it in Chinatown. They have no difficulty there, for the prices are so low that they can go whenever they please. The women there do not care how old the boys are, whether five years old or more, as long as they have money.”\n",
      "White prostitutes far outnumbered Chinese prostitutes, yet they were not similarly vilified because according to the Chief of Police, “white women would not allow boys of ten, eleven, or fourteen years of age to enter their houses.” Moreover, “The prices are higher, and boys of that age will not take the liberties with white women that they do in Chinatown.”\n",
      "While there was no evidence to support these statements, Mary P. Sawtelle published them nevertheless in The Medico-Literary Journal in 1878 in an essay titled, “The Foul Contagious Disease. A Phase of the Chinese Question. How the Chinese Women are Infusing a Poison into the Anglo-Saxon Blood.” These testimonies were reproduced for decades.\n",
      "It is worth noting that Sims, Toland, and Sawtelle were noted pillars of white, liberal society: Sims is credited as “the father of gynecology”; Toland founded a Medical College in his name which he later transferred as a gift to the University of California, San Francisco; and Sawtelle was one of the first women on the West Coast to attend medical school, and also an early suffragist. Each used science and medicine to support claims about Chinese women as both medical and moral threats to White boys as young as ten, eight, and five.\n",
      "Science and medicine are beginning to confront the shameful and painful aspects of its history, including the medical scapegoating of Chinese, the unethical surgeries performed without anesthesia on female slaves, and the promotion of eugenics in order to reduce “unfit” populations. Rather than ignoring this history, Ethnic Studies demands that we confront it—recognizing that we cannot understand the present nor guide a more just future if we do not reckon with the past. A new national survey from the American Historical Association reveals that the overwhelming majority of Americans support teaching history about the harms done to other groups even if it causes discomfort or feelings of guilt. California is leading the nation in this charge. It is time for the rest of the country to follow suit.\n",

      "Hidden among the $52 billion investment to ramp up semiconductor manufacturing and spur research and development for advanced technologies are landmark provisions in place-based policy, which are designed to enable a much wider array of communities across America to participate in, and reap the benefits of, the changing economy. These new initiatives build on increased recognition by policymakers of the challenges associated with growing geographic divergence in economic outcomes.\n",
      "This Act thus provides a unique opportunity to support rural America, which continues to lag behind the rest of the country since the 2008 recession. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, employment and labor rate participation in rural places had not recovered to pre-2008 levels, while metro areas had added significant employment. Although rural employment has fared slightly better than metro areas coming out of the worst of the pandemic’s economic disruption, overall, it remains below pre-2008 levels and far below the urban gains since 2007.\n",

      "Congressional leaders recognize that rural communities are seeking investment and support for strengthening their economic resilience and prosperity, and the place-based CHIPS programs explicitly prioritize these communities through some of their provisions. We analyzed the extent to which the CHIPS and Science Act holds promise for rural communities.\n",
      "1. The Recompete Pilot Program\n",
      "The legislation authorizes a $1 billion pilot program over five years based on the Rebuilding Economies and Creating Opportunities for More People to Excel (RECOMPETE) Act, originally proposed by Representative Derek Kilmer (D-WA), based on an analysis advanced by Tim Bartik. Rep. Kilmer’s original legislation called for 10-year block grants to be awarded to all labor markets and local communities meeting a specified level of distress.1 Based on its formula, the original legislation could have granted approximately $1 billion each to 20 local labor markets, with Cleveland, Ohio and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania receiving $800 million and $1.9 billion respectively. A total of 2,980 areas overall met the threshold of eligibility.\n",
      "The authorization in the CHIPS Act turns this into a competitive pilot program that would award a total of $1 billion over five years. To ensure that the pilot program protects the integrity of the original concept and proves to be an authentic test of the original legislation’s intent will require adherence to its fundamental principles and rationale. Rep. Kilmer’s legislation emphasized:\n",
      "\n",
      "Pre-development investments: Affected areas would be able to access expertise and technical assistance and augment their capacity to develop plans and revitalize their economies.\n",
      "Flexibility: Available funds could be used for a wide range of activities, including those aimed at strengthening local capacity, such as staffing, planning and coordination, and technical expertise.\n",
      "Local determination: Use of the funds would be decided and managed by local leaders, based on plans and solutions that fit their local situation, assets, and history.\n",
      "Adequacy: Funds would be in the form of grants—rather than loans—awarded at a substantial dollar amount that reflect the level of investment necessary to reinvent local economies.2\n",
      "Consistency: Grants would be 10 years in length, as long as localities met certain standards of progress, allowing them to plan and implement over the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "This concept shares many of the attributes that our Reimagining Federal Rural Policy initiative has emphasized to modernize and increase the effectiveness of federal rural policy. It is also similar in its underlying principles to the Rural Partnership Program included in the original Build Back Better Act passed by the House of Representatives in November 2021, which then stalled.\n",

      "The rationale for granting the funds directly to severely distressed communities, ensuring flexibility in the use of funds, and delivering a substantial level of funds over multiple years fits with what rural practitioners have been urging federal policymakers to adopt. This modern approach to community economic development places faith in the idea that distressed communities, including rural communities, have the ability and resilience to adapt to changing economic realities if adequate investment, patience, and data-driven expertise is properly matched with local leadership, vision, and will.\n",
      "A focus on distressed rural areas would enable a more robust test of this concept since it would allow a diversity of sites to receive an adequately proportionate level of investment. Based on the legislation, smaller communities such as New Lexington, Ohio and Bullock County, Alabama would have received $19 million and $30 million, respectively. By spreading proportionately significant grants to smaller communities, the pilot program can impact more places and test its concept more thoroughly.\n",
      "Given these considerations, a successful Recompete pilot program would entail:\n",
      "\n",
      "Full funding: Congress must appropriate the full $1 billion so the pilot is able to rigorously test the underlying fundamentals with sufficient investment among a suitable number of locations.\n",
      "Rural guarantee: The original RECOMPETE legislation did not include any special preference for rural communities since any geographic area meeting the definition of a distressed labor market could participate. For the pilot program, we suggest adding a stipulation that explicitly states that at least 10 rural locations are included. This could stretch the use of the available funds to go beyond the current stated minimum of 10 sites overall, leaving substantial funds to apply to other areas. We would also suggest creating a community of practice among this rural cohort, to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity to advance the state of the art in rural development practice.\n",
      "Equity and geographic diversity: The pilot would also benefit from intentionally identifying locations across different parts of the U.S. and with different demographic characteristics, given differences in regional economies; race, age, and gender characteristics; geographic features; and types of assets.\n",
      "Measurement and evaluation: The pilot program offers an exceptional opportunity to advance knowledge about what is effective in modern community development. Funds should be specifically set aside for evaluation of community-level outcomes by independent third-party experts, with metrics and collection methods designed and integrated—in conjunction with local community members and leaders—into each Recompete plan from the start. This data could support and strengthen a learning agenda integrated into the proposed rural cohort and community of practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Regional technology and innovation hubs\n",
      "Alongside Recompete, CHIPS also authorizes $10 billion for the Economic Development Administration (EDA)—in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)—to create 20 new regional technology and innovation hubs throughout the U.S. A key objective of this effort is to more evenly distribute the prosperity and dynamism associated with the innovation economy beyond existing centers of innovation, such as Silicon Valley, Seattle, and Boston. It would help broaden America’s human capital and research capabilities by leveraging the largely untapped talent within the U.S. heartland to spur economic growth and development.\n",
      "The legislation mandates the inclusion of smaller jurisdictions. At least one-third of the hubs must benefit small or rural communities, defined as a “noncore area, a micropolitan area, or a small metropolitan statistical area (MSA) with a population of not more than 250,000.” In addition, at least one hub must be headquartered in a low population state, defined as a state without an urbanized area with a population greater than 250,000 reported in the decennial census.3\n",
      "While the intention is there, the implementation will matter a great deal. Rural communities are all too familiar with being included in regional development in a way that is ultimately extractive, rather than constructive in retaining the value of their homegrown social and economic assets. Rural America represents 13 percent of the nation’s workforce and only 5 percent of the computer and math jobs. The legislation, if well executed, could help close that gap.\n",
      "This will require avoiding incentives that shift rural innovation and talent to the chosen hub locations. New research suggests that higher innovation in metropolitan areas is associated with poor labor market performance in nonmetropolitan areas—the opposite of the intended outcome. EDA must ensure that the new technology and innovation hubs are actually benefiting small or rural communities, prioritizing sites that will specifically invest in rural areas, as well as transparently measuring the improvements in the specific rural areas included in a hub’s regional coverage.\n",
      "As a first step, the Act also authorizes $50 million in planning grants that must be distributed to at least 60 different eligible groups, reflecting geographic diversity and representation of communities from different populations. One-third of the funding must go to projects that would significantly benefit small or rural communities. EDA is also mandated to consider an applicant’s ability to provide opportunity for economically disadvantaged, minority, underrepresented, and rural populations.\n",
      "These Strategy Grants could play an important role in addressing the capacity gap between rural areas and small- to mid-sized cities and help enable them to be more assertive in the final award process. EDA would do well to use a more specific definition of “rural” for these planning grants to ensure the inclusion of lower-capacity and more remote locations.\n",
      "Up to one-half of the total number of grants are also available for areas to develop plans for the Recompete pilot program. At least 10 of the implementation grants to develop new hubs will go to carrying out approved Recompete plans in localities eligible for both programs.\n",
      "3. Rural STEM education research\n",
      "CHIPS also includes several smaller programs dedicated to improving STEM education and research in rural communities. The bill authorized $20 million over five years for the National Science Foundation (NSF) to advance innovative approaches to STEM teaching in rural schools and broaden participation of rural students in STEM studies. This includes a pilot program of regional cohorts in rural areas to build a community of practice among rural STEM educators and school administrators.\n",
      "Another program establishes a prize competition overseen by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to stimulate innovation in technologies to deploy broadband in rural communities. A program to establish Regional Innovation Engines to advance research and development in key technology focus areas will give special consideration to rural-serving institutions of higher education; successful applicants may collaborate with the selected regional technology hubs.\n",
      "Rural places are a critical link to strengthening American competitiveness and leadership in the innovation and clean energy economies of the future.\n",
      "Other opportunities include funding for online STEM education for rural communities, an evaluation of federal investments in rural STEM education, NSF grants to increase participation in computer science courses through the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program, and modifying the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) to build the STEM education and workforce development capacity of rural communities. The CHIPS funding is the largest Congressional investment in EPSCoR history, mandating that 20 percent of NSF funding is designated for the program.\n",
      "These investments are very welcome, given their underlying intention to increase the readiness for rural residents to participate in the innovation economy. Intentional incentives and complementary partnerships with adjacent investments will be important to help retain that workforce in those rural communities and sustain their value over time.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "The CHIPS and Science Act offers an opportunity for distressed rural places to transform their economic identities and prospects. Rural leaders would do well to take notice of the opportunities, advocate for Congressional appropriation, and see themselves as viable candidates. At the same time, as implementation of these programs unfolds, federal policymakers must ensure that rural places are fairly and adequately represented, and that the unique attributes and challenges they face are accounted for in the design and execution of these programs. Rural places are a critical link to strengthening American competitiveness and leadership in the innovation and clean energy economies of the future.\n",

      "TITLE: \n",
      "In response to the rising prominence of artificial intelligence and after years of investment in digitalization, Germany has taken new steps to institutionalize governmental data analysis. A €239 million investment is building data labs in every ministry and the Chancellery, adding new capacity across the federal government. To succeed, these data labs must be integrated into an already network of ministry data teams, statistical offices, technical services agencies, and government-funded research institutes, raising questions about to best organize the various roles of data analysis in a complex government bureaucracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive overview of the state of governmental data analysis in Germany, offers an assessment of how these data labs can best be used, and provides recommendations for how Germany can further develop its data-driven capabilities.\n",

      "Compared with other wealthy nations, Germany performs below average on international rankings of digitalization and it has been fairly criticized for insufficient progress, despite billions of euros in spending. However, specifically concerning governmental data analysis (a subset of digitalization), the reality is more complex, with Germany lagging in some areas and leading in others. Germany has well-established resources for policy microsimulation and forecasting, making it a leading nation in anticipatory governance. Although historically underutilized, Germany has effective and increasingly formalized approaches to data-driven program evaluation. A few long-standing offices conduct surveys and provide official statistics, although these agencies are highly centralized, and many ministries are struggling with requirements to open data and build data-driven services. Outside of government, data analysis is buoyed by a robust academic environment and growing private sector, offering opportunities to the government to learn and bring in expert talent.\n",
      "Deploying the new data labs with an intentional focus on operational tasks in the federal ministries will make the best use of these resources and help address current shortcomings. To start, the labs should work to ensure the many new data streams from digitalization efforts will be usable for analytical purposes. Because they are placed within the various ministries, these labs are better positioned to develop expertise in implementing algorithmic processes, as compared to other centralized technical agencies. Their placement also uniquely enables the data labs to develop data-data culture and provide domain-specific training on using data within their respective ministries. Finally, the Chancellery’s data lab is best suited to helping the ministry labs overcome shared bureaucratic burdens and playing a coordinating role in emergency situations to enable rapid cross-governmental data analyses.\n",
      "Even with this important new investment in data capacity, there are other steps Germany can take to better institutionalize governmental data analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "Install chief evaluation officers in each ministry’s leadership to better incorporate data-driven evidence into everyday policymaking.\n",
      "Create new pathways for data scientists to enter government to prepare Germany for its long-term talent needs.\n",
      "Seek to better understand its capacities by surveying government employees on their use of data and considering the evolving data needs of regulators.\n",
      "Develop a comprehensive government plan that delineates between the roles of the technology authorities to create accountability and prevent duplication of efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "introduction\n",
      "The German government has a history of data analysis that extends back even before Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III, who created the Royal Prussian Statistical Bureau in 1805.1 Yet recent trends, especially the huge investment in digital services2 and the rising prominence of artificial intelligence (AI), have heightened interest in how data can improve governance. In January 2021, the Federal Data Strategy called for all federal ministries to hire a Chief Data Scientist.3 Shortly thereafter, the German Recovery and Resilience Plan reiterated this requirement and allocated €239 million to establish a data lab in every ministry and the Chancellery.4 These investments are intended to build on top of the multi-billion euro investment in digitalizing government services,5 and beyond its own borders, Germany has placed itself at the center of Europe’s digitalization efforts through the 2020 Berlin Declaration on Digital Society.6\n",
      "This renewed focus on data will likely persist into Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s new government—the first section of the new Chancellor’s coalition agreement is entitled “Modern State, Digital Awakening and Innovation,” and calls for federal administration not only to become more digital, but also more proactive in supporting citizens.7 Clearly, there are changes to come, as evinced by the expanded scope of technology issues given to the newly renamed Ministry for Digital Affairs and Transportation.8 Despite these new responsibilities, government digitalization is fairly dispersed, with important roles for the Ministries for Interior, Finance, Education and Research, Economic Affairs and Climate Action, International Development, and Foreign Affairs. As for the Chancellery, it seems that Chancellor Scholz may have less interest in leading these efforts than his predecessor, Angela Merkel.9\n",
      "“Data analysis is becoming ever more important to core functions of governance, both through existing mechanisms, such as official statistics and program evaluation, but also more recent developments such as algorithmic processes.”\n",
      "Regardless of who leads these efforts, the German government should work to develop a comprehensive and long-term vision for effective public sector data use. Data analysis is becoming ever more important to core functions of governance, both through existing mechanisms, such as official statistics and program evaluation, but also more recent developments such as algorithmic processes. The rapid advance of private sector applications of data also poses a challenge, creating a stark contrast to antiquated government services that can undermine trust in public institutions, and further challenges governments to learn and adapt data science methods for regulating the private sector.\n",
      "These trends are evident today, and so governmental capacity for data analysis should be considered a foundational pillar of modernizing Germany’s public administration.\n",
      "data Analysis capacity in german federal governance\n",
      "Understanding the current state of data and digitalization in the German public sector is a prerequisite for effectively deploying new resources—such as the data labs—and identifying what other steps Germany should take. A recent report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) categorizes the value of data to governance into three broad activities: (1) anticipation and planning; (2) service delivery; and (3) evaluation and monitoring.10 These categories offer a useful starting point for the German context, where digitalization and new algorithmic processes are changing service delivery. Anticipatory governance has seen recent changes too, with new approaches to microsimulation and an increased interest in forecasting. Further, Germany has established systems for monitoring through program evaluation, official statistics, and open data, although many challenges remain. Still, it is important to go beyond the OECD’s framing, and consider a fourth category of (4) related non-governmental factors, especially civil society, academia, and the private sector. The four-part typology is undoubtedly flawed[i] and omits many important topics,[ii] but it provides a useful framework to broadly divide how the German government is using data analysis.\n",
      "(1) Anticipatory Governance\n",
      "Anticipatory governance is the use of data to better forecast the future state of policy-relevant information (usually with statistical forecasting models) and more rigorously estimate the effect of policy changes (usually with microsimulation models). The German government funds a range of sophisticated microsimulation models for analyzing potential policy changes that are maintained by independent research firms and academics. This includes MikroSim, a novel and complex effort to simulate each of Germany’s more than 10,000 municipalities for population dynamics, education, and income, using synthetic population data.11 Other examples include tax and transfer models from at least five institutes,12 as well as Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research’s corporate taxation model,13 and an old-age insurance model from the Fraunhofer Institute.14 Beyond the policy planning value of these models, they also demonstrate the capacity of German policy research institutes to develop large and resource-intensive data-driven modeling systems.\n",
      "Several German policy institutions also work on statistical forecasting models that are used to make predictions about the likely outcome of future trends and are considered valuable for anticipatory governance. Economic forecasts are the most common, including estimates of GDP, inflation, employment, and even sectoral-specific metrics.1516 The Joint Economic Forecast, a collaboration between five independent research institutes, pools data-driven predictions for a biannual report to guide economic policy.17 Environmental models, such as those for measuring flood risk, are also used to inform emergency preparedness.18 In response to the recent prominence of immigration issues, various research institutes1920 and the Federal Office of Migration and Refugees21 are also making attempts to forecast future migration demand into Germany. The Federal Foreign Office’s PREVIEW is an attempt to build a crisis early warning system which started in 2017.22 Overall, these anticipatory government efforts are well-developed, although much of the capacity for this type of data analysis lies outside the federal government.\n",
      "(2) Data-driven service delivery\n",
      "Germany’s enormous investments in government digitalization, led by the Interior Ministry,23 is significantly increasing the amount of data and data infrastructure across the government. The Online Access Act and subsequent decisions will allocate over €5 billion to digitize nearly 600 different types of government services, affecting all 15 federal ministries, as well as 16 state and over 11,000 local governments.24 However, as of mid-2021, only 54 services were available online. [iii] A federal advisory agency, the National Regulatory Control Council (NKR), has determined that, despite recent momentum, the program will not meet its target deadline of the end of 2022.25 Still, these extensive digitalization efforts promise to create many new streams of data and additional technical infrastructure that could provide significant opportunities for future data analytics and algorithmic processes.\n",
      "Several authorities are supporting the government digitalization and are relevant to the state of data analysis—especially ITZBund and Digital Service 4 Germany. Starting in 2015, disparate federal IT capacities have been integrated into a consolidated federal office, ITZBund,26 including the Bundescloud, a new national cloud service. This Bundescloud offers several basic cloud services,27 including a software development platform that could be used for data science applications.28 This is part of Germany’s “multi-cloud approach,”29 which aims to both encourage private providers to offer cloud services using data centers in Germany,3031 and develop its own internal government cloud capacity.32 Digital Service 4 Germany is a notable technical services agency housed in the Chancellery,33 akin to the United States Digital Service. Although Digital Services 4 Germany is more focused on digitalization and software development, its work will often overlap with data analysis and data science applications.\n",
      "Germany is also seeking to reduce administrative burdens on users of government services, the purpose behind the Register Modernization Act of 2020. This law seeks to advance the “once-only principle,” meaning users of government services are only asked to supply a data point once, not multiple times by different forms or ministries.34 Reducing administration burdens, as required by the European Union’s (EU) Single Digital Gateway Regulation,35 is the primary goal, but this regulation has the added value of necessitating interoperability and a common identifier between various ministry databases—furthering the databases’ value for data analytic purposes. The most prominent example is that this integration can more easily enable the counting of the German population, which does not conduct a survey-based census.36 Recently, the NKR said the register modernization effort was “still in its infancy.”37\n",
      "Beyond simply replacing paper with electronic forms, ministries have begun to expand the use of algorithms in government processes formerly performed by people. One example is the Ministry of Labor’s newly-automated analysis of forms required for government child support payments.38 While document processing is relatively commonplace in government, more ambitious projects are also in the works, such as the Ministry for Digital Affairs and Transportation’s trial project to automate highway damage monitoring.39 A recent report on the use of AI in public authorities documents these and ten other cases studies, but also notes that governments needs more data analytics talent, as well as better standards for the use of algorithms in government.40 A survey of federal ministries by the Ministry of Education and Research publicly documented 79 deployed AI systems41 and 190 further pilot and research projects,42 although the information is sparse. Of the deployed systems, almost none had gone through any algorithmic risk assessment, and several ministries seemed not to even understand the concept of an algorithmic risk assessment.43 Of the 79 documented AI systems, 35 were developed internally by ministries and 35 were externally developed by private companies or universities. ITZBund is involved in developing the remaining nine AI services for other ministries, including the Ministry of Finance, the Customs Investigation Bureau, the Federal Tax Office, and the Financial Intelligence Unit.44\n",
      "(3) Monitoring and evaluation\n",
      "Germany has a mature program of official statistics, largely run by a few independent federal authorities with deep expertise, especially the Federal Statistical Office of Germany (Destatis),45 the Institute for Employment Research,46 and the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).47 Destatis is the principal data owner, and has its own extensive digitalization plan that aims to bring together its own survey data, ministry registry data, and external experimental data collections.48 All these authorities are experimenting with emerging data science approaches, such as IER using digital trace data for labor market measures,49 Destatis using mobile phone data to see effects of COVID restrictions on mobility,50 and RKI making use of citizen’s data donations.51 While Germany displays mature capacities in official statistics, the federal statistical functions are relatively centralized in these few authorities[iv] and are progressively more directed by E.U. requirements.52\n",
      "Data-driven program evaluation remains among the most critical contributions of governmental data use,53 but its use in Germany has been only recently, and partially, systematized. In 2013, an effort started to create a systematic evaluation procedure for all laws and regulations estimated to have over €1 million in compliance costs,54 but otherwise, there is no federal or state law requiring program evaluation.55 Despite no universal standard, it has become increasingly common for laws to include clauses that require an ex-post evaluation some years after the law’s implementation.\n",
      "While the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development has had an evaluation unit since 197156 as well as an associated institute,57 this is the exception, not the norm. Evaluations are frequent in some other policy fields, especially in labor policy,5859 social programs, and higher education.60 The government leans heavily on the economic and social science research institutes in the Leibniz Association and Fraunhofer Society, as well as private contractors61 to perform this work.62 This may reflect a somewhat recent change, as, at the prompting of the German Research Council, many of the Leibniz Association institutes made significant investments in evidence-based policy during the 2000s.63 External institutes are generally able to work with the government administrative data necessary to perform these ex-post evaluations. Despite starting later relative to its peer countries, Germany has quickly developed an expansive system of researcher access to sensitive administrative data.64 The German Data Forum now has accredited 38 research data centers that offer access to this confidential governmental data,65 more than the United States’ 31.66\n",
      "In June 2021, the Bundestag adopted the Second Open Data Act and the Data Usage Act, expanding its commitment to publicly releasing machine-readable data.67 In 2019, two years after the passing of the first open data act, 75% of agencies had an open data officer, but 57% of agencies said there was insufficient staffing for their legal obligations.68 Still, there are currently tens of thousands of datasets on GovData.de centralized data portal, and while the amount of data contributed varies dramatically between federal ministries,69 most will be required to open up data by 2023 under the new open data strategy.70 This also requires an expansion of the number of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for government data by 2024, building on the 30 that are available now.71 Beyond broadening public access to data, the new coalition agreement calls for a new data institute that would help open government data in order to fuel new business models and social innovations.72\n",
      "A final governmental factor is the receptiveness of policymakers to data and evidence, or the culture of evidence-based policymaking. A 2011 expert survey of 19 OECD countries assigned Germany the 2nd lowest score for the use of program evaluations in government.73 This is a concerning rank, but it is based on the presence or absence of formal arrangements for disseminating evaluations to policymakers, and thus does not measure the culture or tendencies of policymakers using evidence. Regardless, there have been signs of progress in the last decade. The Bundestag has also not historically been especially invested in commissioning or using evaluations, but references to empirical evaluations in Bundestag materials nearly quintupled (568 to 2451) from the 15th Bundestag (2002-2005) to the 18th Bundestag (2013-2017).74 Several organizations are also working to improve the culture of evidence, including the German Economic Association, which released principles for better evidence-based policymaking,75 and the Halle Institute, which founded a Centre for Evidence-based Policy Advice.76 In 2021, the Federal Academy for Public Administration launched the Digital Academy77 to train public servants in digital skills, including data literacy.78 These developments reflect a growing appreciation that the value of government data is not automatic, but must be understood and consciously integrated into policymaking.\n",
      "(4) Non-governmental factors: Civil society, academia, and the private sector\n",
      "There are several external factors that will significantly affect the government’s ability to make advances on data use. This includes academic programs as key pipelines of new data talent and independent civil society organizations that can drive new data science applications. Further, the general perspective and opinion of German citizens matters, as politics impacts what is possible for government data.\n",
      "Nonprofit organizations have begun to develop lines of data science work that complement government efforts. The nonprofits Correlaid, DatenSchule, Data Science for Social Good-Berlin, and Code for Germany offer partnerships and trainings to help bring data expertise into social good organizations. Other organizations have recently started to build data capacity for studying societal problems, including the think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung79 and the Bertelsmann Foundation.80 The German government is also supporting some civil society experimentation with AI through small (€20,000) grants awarded by the new Civic Innovation Platform.81\n",
      "Academia also plays a key role, both by creating pipelines of new talent for civil service and performing informative research. There is an emerging cohort of master’s programs that specifically focus on data and governance. These include programs focused on applied data science and how it overlaps with policy, as in the Hertie School’s M.S. in Data Science for Public Policy,82 or social science, as in the University of Konstanz’s MSc in Social and Economic Data Science.83 Mannheim University’s new Master of Applied Data Science and Measurement has a unique emphasis on the challenges of data collection, particularly useful in governance.84 Also notable is Friedrich-Alexander University, which is one of the partner institutions in the new E.U.-funded Master of AI for Public Services.85 More broadly than policy and social science, Germany leads the EU in specialized AI academic programs.86\n",
      "The academic research community in data analytics, AI, and related fields is also quite strong. Germany ranks around fifth or sixth in a number of AI publications, depending on the precise metric used.87 To improve further, the National AI Strategy called for 100 new AI professorships, and various efforts such as those by the state of Bavaria88 and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation may help Germany exceed this goal.89 Especially valuable to governance are the programs that focus on the overlap between data science and social sciences, such as those mentioned above.\n",

      "The private sector, whose skills and expertise can be harnessed and exchanged with the federal government, is also a strength for Germany. Looking at both academia and the private sector, Germany has the most researchers working in science and technology in the EU.90 In terms of talent, Germany’s private sector ranks 6th in both investment in AI and in AI hiring. Further, Germany ranks 4th among 13 leading countries in AI skill prevalence (27% higher than the global average) and is especially strong in the industries of Hardware, as well as Networking and Manufacturing.91 However, according to the European Investment Bank, Germany lags behind both the United States and the EU average in the digitalization of other private industries, including construction, services, and infrastructure.92\n",
      "Finally, as in any democracy, the perspective and the trust of the German people are key factors in its government’s continued ability to use data. One approach is to consider the extent to which German citizens use digital services, although these numbers vary: the EU’s Digital Economy and Society Index reported that in 2020, 69% of citizens in the past year had used a digital government service.93 However, a report from the German government says that only 40% of citizens submitted a form or application to the government online in the past year.94 This disparity may reflect that German citizens would prefer to use online government services, but are stymied by the common requirement of paper form submissions with handwritten signatures.95 The same report found that 40.7% of Germans saw AI as an asset, compared to 26.5% who saw it as a threat—these numbers coming before the government of neighboring Netherlands had to resign over an algorithm that erroneously punished families for benefits fraud.9697 A 2014 poll found that the German people were especially concerned with data privacy, with 80% being reluctant to share data with businesses.98 However, Germans showed more trust in their government in a 2018 survey, with just over 40 percent expressing concerns about data security in online public services.99\n",
      "Summary and international framing \n",
      "Overall, these factors describe a mature governmental use of data, with Germany lagging other wealthy nations in several areas and leading in a few. There are a few international rankings from the EU, UN, and OECD that warrant consideration, although they tend to focus more on law and procedure and less on harder-to-measure ‘on-the-ground’ factors that might be more informative. The European Commission’s (EC’s) Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) estimates that Germany’s digital public services are about average among EU members.100 This top-level estimate masks significant variation within the sub-indicators, as Germany ranks 8th in open data, 10th in e-Government users, 12th in digital public services for businesses, 16th in digital public services for citizens, and 23rd in pre-filled forms (which is a useful proxy for how interconnected ministry databases are).101\n",
      "The OECD’s Digital Government Index is more critical, putting Germany third to last in its ranking of “data-driven public sector.” However, this analysis was last performed in 2019, and counts against Germany several points that have since been rectified, including the lack of a public sector data policy, no plan for intragovernmental data sharing, and no requirement of chief data officers.102 The United Nations E-Government Survey scored Germany as in middle country among 33 European nations evaluated. Despite a strong showing on Germany’s human capital development, the UN scored Germany poorly on the government digital services—an analysis that aligns with that of the EC’s DESI.103\n",
      "Germany’s capacities in microsimulation models and independent researcher access to government administrative data are areas in which the country leads. The academic environment is also relatively strong, both in AI research generally, and specifically in emerging pipelines of public-sector technical talent. This is critical because having an expansive talent pool makes it far easier to rectify other capacity issues in the short term. More broadly, however, non-governmental civil society efforts are nascent and appear to be trying to catch up to current practices, rather than innovating and leading.\n",
      "Policy and operational recommendations\n",
      "This section discusses the additional steps to improve Germany’s public sector data capacities, but it is first worth discussing what should be done with changes already in progress—specifically, the new ministry data labs, the Chancellery’s data lab, and the Data Service Center. The data labs are best placed to use data to directly support the operational work of ministries through developing data pipelines, implementing algorithmic services, and fostering an analytical culture. The Chancellery data lab is better suited for a coordinating role, especially for emergencies, as well as enabling the ministry labs to overcome bureaucratic challenges. Finally, the new Data Service Center can handle especially difficult technical challenges that are shared across the data labs and other centers of data analysis.\n",
      "Beyond establishing these offices, Germany should consider a range of other policies to improve its capacity for, and use of, data analysis. To improve the internal capacity and the culture of evidence-based policy, Germany should require and fund a chief evaluation officer in every ministry and consider other new entry points for technical talent. To better learn about the current state of capacity, Germany should employ surveys of government employees on these topics, and especially consider the evolving role of regulatory data science, which has so far been under-discussed. The federal government should also develop a central strategy and organizational chart that clearly defines the roles of the many public agencies with data analytics responsibilities. Finally, there are further steps that can be taken to strengthen data science in relevant civil society organizations.\n",
      "Ministry data labs should focus on operational data science\n",
      "The newly-installed or incoming chief data scientists and their data labs should focus on the tasks that benefit most from using internal data talent and also address Germany’s deficiencies in institutional data. Broadly, the data tasks that meet both of these criteria are operational, in that they directly support day-to-day ministerial function, as opposed to data-driven evaluations or anticipatory governance. Of course, the needs of different ministries will vary, but generally, data labs should give special priority to the following operational tasks:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensuring data from digitalization is analytically usable: The enormous effort by German ministries, states, and localities to digitize their public services does not guarantee that the resulting data will be useful for analytical purposes. Data labs can and should play a key role by being an advocate for effective collection, documentation, and storage of digital services data so that it is valuable for other purposes. Given the rapid pace and enormous scale of the digitalization efforts, this is likely a time-consuming, but highly important, line of work. This work aligns well with a task explicitly handed to the data labs by the Recovery Plan, which is to build a nationwide Data Atlas.104 As the data labs better document their own databases, they should also collaborate to build this cross-ministerial overview of all federal government data.\n",
      "Building data-driven culture and capacity: Data labs can also work to enable broader data access and use within their ministry. This might mean helping employees get database access where ministry employees can themselves perform data analysis, or through dashboards, where data has been preprocessed and visualized for them. One model for this work is the U.S. Commerce Department’s Data Academy, which in 2016 and 2017 put on a series of trainings105 for over 1,600 departmental staff to improve their data analytics capacity.106 The Commerce data team also used these trainings to identify strong candidates for more advanced data education, helping create new centers of expertise across the department. In doing trainings, the ministry data labs should be careful not to build duplicative content with that of the National Digital Academy, which already has at least one course on data literacy.107 The data labs should instead go deeper into ministerial-specific data and how it can inform the day-to-day work of ministry staff. The data labs will be uniquely positioned to do this because of their proximity to operational employees and expertise working with ministry-specific data.\n",
      "Data-driven and algorithmic processes: Due to their proximity to the front lines of government service delivery, the new data labs can work to identify existing processes that would most benefit from automation and algorithms. This can help address the relatively poor performance of Germany’s digital public services, as well as the shortage of AI talent as reported in the aforementioned AI in public authorities report. To be most successful, the new data labs should generally work to improve upon workflows that ministries are already doing rather than attempting to build entirely new processes. While improving the function of government should be the core goal of the data labs, there is some evidence that these investments in analytics can also save significant funds by reducing fraud and waste.108\n",
      "Institutionalize new data pipelines: The data labs are well-positioned to build new data collection pipelines, bringing novel external data into governance. The authorities with established data capacities already do some of this work (i.e., Destatis, RKI, and IER, as mentioned in the monitoring and evaluation section), but most do not. Where possible, ministry data labs should build on successful proof-of-concepts from academia and civil society, and use the consistency of government funding to productionize (or make permanent and sustainable) the data pipelines. Ideally, these new data collections would both inform ministry function and be released to the public as open data.\n",
      "\n",
      "These priorities are core functions of governance and would be an investment in the areas that German governance needs most. Reflecting this, the data labs should also strive to build internal capacity, while minimizing procurement or outsourcing. One reason the data labs are so valuable is they can offer routine interaction between ministerial staff and data analysis expertise, which is where the operational value of data analysis is realized. Further, data analysis is a core and structural function of government, not the short-term projects or insulated deliverables that are suitable for consulting or contracting. This means the procured software and solutions are likely to be permanent costs, risking vendor lock-in while losing internal capacity and undermining data-driven culture.109 The data labs should keep as much funding internally as possible, using open-source software and creating new tools that government can iterate and improve on over time.\n",
      "“One reason the data labs are so valuable is they can offer routine interaction between ministerial staff and data analysis expertise, which is where the operational value of data analysis is realized.”\n",
      "While these operational tasks should be done in-house, not all data analyses need to be performed internally, and this roadmap for the data labs intentionally prioritizes a few tasks and leaves others out. For instance, the performance of program evaluation is not best served by the data labs, as this can continue to be done by independent research organizations. Program evaluations are a lengthy and complex type of data analysis that often takes months or years, and so an independent institute can perform and deliver results intermittently. Further, it is an advantage to have program evaluation done by independent research organizations that may be less prone to political influence when reporting their findings. This is also true for microsimulation and forecasting tasks, in contrast to operational data analysis and algorithmic systems in the federal government where outside research institutes would be less effective. Otherwise, procurement should largely be used for either general-purpose software and tasks that are common in both government and private sector, or for highly specialized projects that government cannot reasonably be expected to do.\n",
      "Similarly, the continued development of APIs is also not an ideal goal for data labs, although they may contribute to the process by cleaning and preparing data. This task is better categorized as data engineering than data analysis, and while it requires a specific set of technical skills, its execution is less specific to the domain knowledge. This means that a single entity, for instance the Digital Services 4 Germany or ITZBund, could develop expertise in API development and perform this task across the ministries, rather than having each data lab learn to build high-quality APIs. More broadly, it may prevent duplicative work and prevent conflict if Digital Services 4 Germany, ITZBund, and other technical agencies generally leave data analytic work that requires domain knowledge and routine interaction with ministry staff to the ministry data labs.\n",
      "The Chancellery’s data lab as coordinator and enabler\n",
      "The strategic location of the new data lab within the Chancellor’s office, without a specific ministerial function to support and so close to the highest levels of policymaking, warrants a different approach. The Chancellor’s data lab should invest in the capacity to perform rapid cross-governmental data analyses to respond to emergency situations. This approach was pioneered by the New York City Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA), where the team practiced “data drills” to better execute the interdepartmental integration of data sets.110 MODA developed this approach after the office encountered difficulties combining datasets in an (ultimately successful) effort to use data science to help respond to the 2015 outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease in New York City.111 Similarly, due to its location within the White House, the United States Digital Service has also been known to work on high-pressure interagency data and technology problems. By using its centrality and political authority, the Chancellery data lab can bring together data experts from across government ministries, quickly break down barriers, and deliver emergency data services.\n",
      "This work would also help the Chancellor’s data lab identify barriers to collaboration, which aligns well with a second stream of pertinent work: coordinating and advocating for the structural and bureaucratic changes necessary to support the ministerial data labs. This portfolio might also include enabling the use of open-source programming languages for data science, such as R and Python,[v] or expanding access to collaborative development software such as git. It could also include ensuring that ministry data labs can hire data science talent with appropriate titles and pay scales, which is called for by the Federal Data Strategy and has been done for other IT specialists.112 It may also be worth ensuring that funding streams are consistent and flexible enough such that ministries have a real choice between hiring permanent staff and using procurement.\n",
      "The importance of these bureaucratic changes should not be downplayed. The needs of civic technology and data analysis in the United States has led to fundamental changes, including smaller and faster procurement (called modular contracting113), new job titles,114 and may even result in a dramatically improved federal hiring process.115 This is a sufficiently critical line of work to warrant making permanent the head of the Chancellery data lab and creating the title of Chief Data Scientist (or Officer) of the federal government, a role that has existed in the United States since 2015.116\n",
      "The Data Service Center can provide technical expertise\n",
      "The Federal Data Strategy also calls for the creation of a new office, the Data Service Center (DSC), for cooperating around data use and evidence-based evaluation. While the Chancellery’s data lab should take the lead on bureaucratic challenges to data use, the DSC can instead tackle technical challenges that are shared across the data labs. This might include specializing in providing guidance and support for challenging data-specific tasks related to open data, cloud-based analysis, and algorithmic services.\n",
      "The DSC may be especially valuable in helping develop best practices for the expanding number of algorithmic services being built by federal ministries. For instance, this includes collaborating across ministries and data labs to create standardized reporting, as in the UK,117 as well as a public registry of algorithms, as has been implemented by both Amsterdam and Helsinki,118 and is in progress in the United States.119 This registry can build on the survey by the Ministry of Education and Research, but should be formalized, placed on a public website, given substantially more detail, and updated regularly.\n",
      "“The DSC may be especially valuable in helping develop best practices for the expanding number of algorithmic services being built by federal ministries.”\n",
      "Further, ministries should assess the potential level of harm and develop formalized processes for minimizing that risk, such as benchmarking the algorithm’s performance to an ongoing human comparison.120 Canada’s algorithmic impact assessment tool121 and the Ada Lovelace Institute’s algorithmic impact assessment case study122 are both potential models for this work.\n",
      "Drawing precise boundaries between the DSC and other existing agencies may be challenging and should be done carefully. For instance, the DSC might provide best practices for the process of opening up government data, such as for data cleaning, anonymization processes, and stakeholder engagement. However, hosting the open data should still be left to the\n",
      "Ministry of Interior’s GovData.de platform team and the DSC may not be best suited to support API development, since this is a separate set of specialized skills more similar to web development, for which expertise may already exist in technology agencies like Digital Service 4 Germany or ITZBund. Similarly, while the DSC should not replicate ITZBund’s effort to create cloud services, it could instead develop expertise in interoperable data analysis tools to aid various data teams to work effectively with the multi-cloud strategy.\n",
      "Other recommendations and lessons from the United States\n",
      "Starting under the Obama administration, the United States renewed a focus on civic technology and data science which has since produced significant progress, although with noteworthy missteps. These efforts illustrate several possibilities for Germany to improve other aspects of data-driven governance, beyond those discussed above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Install chief evaluation officers—To further improve the institutionalization of evidence-based policymaking, Germany should consider adding a chief evaluation officer to every federal ministry. Evaluation officers look to actively incorporate existing empirical evidence (from government and external sources) into everyday policymaking. This is distinct from the data labs and chief data scientists in that evaluation officers are only reviewing and synthesizing evidence for imminent policy choices. Since ministries are strong pillars of federal policymaking and are hierarchical in nature, placing evaluation officers directly subordinate to the Minister (in the Leitungsbereich) could be highly impactful. Evaluation officers might also review ministry functions to identify necessary evaluations and build further infrastructure to improve their quality.123 These officers could also further formalize the role of evaluation in the ministries, both by documenting the current state of evaluation use, and by writing an official policy detailing the circumstances in which the ministry performs program evaluations.124\n",
      "Create new government talent pathways—Germany has an aging public workforce, with the proportion of government employees aged 18-34 falling from 30% in 2020 to 15% in 2015.125 Beyond the employees and trainings of the data labs, policymakers should also look to enable new pathways for data science talent. For instance, the Chancellery could build on the success of the tech4Germany fellowship, which brings technologists into the federal government for three-month sprints,126 to include data science projects. Developing a program analogous to the U.S.’s Civic Digital Fellowship, which attracts technically talented students to government internships, is another option.127 Lastly, Germany should consider creating a Chancellery Innovation Fellowship, analogous to the Presidential Innovation Fellowship, and using the prestige of such an opportunity to bring in high-quality talent that might not have otherwise considered government service. The strong academic environment in Germany makes it more likely that programs like this can be successful in helping build internal capacity, and Germany should also consider how to best improve exchanges and networking between these sectors.128\n",
      "Consider the data needs of regulators—The oversight responsibilities of government ministries are also becoming more data-intensive, meaning that many public authorities will eventually need to be able to securely analyze private data for regulatory purposes.129 This will be especially true for ministries that are handed obligations through new EU legislation such as the AI Act.130 Although Germany has developed some relevant expertise through implementing the General Data Protection Regulation, most of the oversight from this act is enforced at the state level.131 In the near future, Germany will likely need to consider how its data infrastructure can support the expanding data analysis requirements of its regulating agencies.\n",
      "Survey government employees about data use—The analysis and discussion in this report are significantly limited by a lack of information about the everyday use of data by federal employees. It is not clear how capable the average federal employee is in interpreting, collecting, or analyzing data, nor is it clear if they have necessary data access for their jobs. Surveys of selected subsections of federal employees could shed further light on these questions, as well as how competencies vary across ministries. In the United States, the Data Foundation has developed surveys for senior data staff, including chief data officers132 and chief evaluation officers.133 Germany should implement internal government surveys and monitoring that get at these questions, both of senior staff such as the new chief data scientists, and of other federal employees who do not primarily work as data analysts.\n",
      "Delineate clear boundaries between technology authorities—A range of agencies and authorities have responsibilities relevant to governmental data use, including ITZBund, Digital Service 4 Germany, Destatis, the GovData.de platform team, as well as the upcoming ministry data labs, the Data Service Center, and the possible new data institute, among others. This ecosystem is sufficiently complex that these agencies are likely to build repetitive and overlapping expertise without a single document or strategy that clearly divides up organizational responsibilities. If an emergency data analysis is needed by the Chancellery, does the ministry data lab perform it, or can Digital Service 4 Germany? If a new data tool would help several ministries, does this task fall to the Data Service Center or ITZBund? A single governmental document with clear organizational responsibilities and boundaries could help answer these questions, and offer a comprehensive government-wide vision for data analytics responsibilities.\n",
      "Strengthen data science in civil society—Germany’s civil society policy research institutions, including think tanks, have only limited capacity in emerging data science methods, hampering innovation in civic data science. In the United States, independent think tanks lead the government on innovative uses of data science for policy research. For example, the Center for Security and Emerging Technology’s Map of Science, a categorization and analysis of 260 million scientific documents,134 enables conclusions about which countries are leading in AI-driven robotics research (i.e., that Germany leads the world in robotics for automotive engineering).135 Alternatively, the Urban Institute creates novel data systems for policymaking, such as the Spatial Equity Data Tool, which identifies geographic disparities across populations and the distribution of government services.136 These are just two examples of how civil society organizations can develop new data applications that government can use and build on. In Germany, while the Civic Innovation Platform has provided some funding for civil society innovation with data, 137 the €20,000 awards are not sufficient to support ongoing institutional efforts. Germany should increase this funding or create a new line of grants for expanding data science in independent policy research.\n",

      "[i] It is challenging to categorize governmental data use, which has both dependencies (e.g., analysis depends on data collection and storage) as well as cyclical elements (e.g., data analysis can affect what data is collected). Further, some data analyses may serve multiple purposes—a study intended to decide on an intervention’s efficacy might also be used to guide its future implementation (planning).

      "In a speech at a local community college, President Biden underscored the catalytic role of the CHIPS and Science Act in securing Micron’s investment. The act funds $280 billion to support research, technology development, and the modernizing and scaling up of the domestic semiconductor industry. Onshoring semiconductor production has mainly been framed in terms of national economic security, but these major manufacturing and research investments will also matter greatly to the local economies that receive them. \n",
      "The developments in Syracuse signal a new kind of industrial policy taking shape in regions across the country, which will play host to large manufacturing plants like Micron’s semiconductor facility. Even so, across these regions, long-standing inequities raise the question of whether low-income people, people of color, and women will share in the gains from this advanced industry growth. For well-documented reasons, a rising tide in these regional economies spurred by generous public tax incentives may not lift all boats. \n",
      "To avoid this dynamic, leaders in New York worked with Micron to structure a “Community Investment Framework” that aims to maximize the impact of the manufacturer’s construction, operational, and philanthropic expenditures on inclusive regional development.  \n",
      "In exchange for generous state-level tax credits, the Framework creates the potential for the state to enforce standards related to Micron’s business practices in areas such as labor, supplier procurement, and environmental sustainability. The Framework also secures commitments from Micron to invest in workforce development, education, and community development. To guide the latter, the Empire State Development and Micron announced the creation of a $500 million Green CHIPS Community Investment Fund, as well as a Community Advisory Committee to ensure that the fund’s ultimate investments are aligned with community needs in four key categories: education, workforce development, housing, and community projects.  \n",
      "On paper, the Community Investment Framework has large ambitions and early commitments, making it an approach that bears watching for two reasons. First, the Framework creates expectations for how Micron targets temporary construction jobs, more “permanent” manufacturing jobs, and local procurement toward more inclusive outcomes. Inclusive local employment and procurement are two economic “linkages” that have proven essential toward making regional development more equitable and inclusive. Still, in and of themselves, they do not guarantee things like accessible and high-quality training, high wages, career pathways, or supplier growth—but they offer tangible entry points for local workers and entrepreneurs.   \n",
      "Second, the Framework brings together Micron, local and state government, and philanthropy—with the prospect of significant federal grant money from the Commerce Department as well—to build the regional capacity that will help Micron meet its local employment and procurement targets. \n",
      "It will take both approaches—corporate commitments on local linkages and private and public investments to prepare the community for these new opportunities—to ensure that the nation’s emergent industrial strategy translates into inclusive local development benefitting all communities, workers, and entrepreneurs.   \n",
      "Federal incentives are sparking a ‘big build’ for semiconductors \n",
      "Micron’s Syracuse investment was influenced by August’s passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, which established a 25% investment tax credit, a $39 billion fund to incentivize chipmakers to reestablish production domestically and $13 billion for research and development and workforce development. The legislation responds to both short-term economic challenges and longer-term economic and security priorities. During the pandemic, U.S.-based manufacturers struggled through supply chain bottlenecks and semiconductor shortages revealing the need for greater domestic production capacity to deliver everything from consumer electronics to electric vehicles to industrial equipment. Longer term, semiconductors also have national security significance, given their prominent role in military and general-use technologies, such as artificial intelligence.  \n",
      "Due in part to this more activist federal industrial policy, semiconductor companies are in the beginning stages of a “big build” as they rapidly construct and expand facilities across the nation. Beyond Syracuse, the CHIPS legislation also figured prominently in Intel’s recent investment in the Columbus, Ohio region; Samsung’s potential expansion in the Austin, Texas region; IBM’s expansion in Poughkeepsie, N.Y; and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s expansion in the Phoenix, Arizona region. According to Semiconductor Industry Association, over the past two years, semiconductor manufacturers have announced nearly $200 billion in new investments for the next decade.  \n",
      "As Micron and other companies build these semiconductor facilities, they will seek direct subsidies from the Commerce Department’s CHIPS for America Fund (part of the CHIPS and Science Act) to partially offset the costs. Yet, as outlined in its implementation strategy, the Fund’s objectives extend well beyond factory construction projects, with one of its key objectives being to “grow a diverse semiconductor workforce and build strong communities that participate in the prosperity of the industry.”  \n",
      "That objective is highly significant. As semiconductor manufacturers apply for these subsidies, they will not only need to demonstrate that they have sought co-investment in the form of tax incentives from local and state governments, but also that they are making commitments to local workers and suppliers and partnering with government, higher education, and nonprofits on broader community investment strategies to advance inclusive local and regional development.  \n",
      "Creating a framework for smart business incentives and region-wide benefits \n",
      "As an older industrial region in the heart of America’s manufacturing belt, the Syracuse metro area and broader central New York region is an archetypal place in which to advance the federal government’s vision for inclusive economic innovation. \n",
      "Micron plans to build its complex at the White Pine Commerce Park in Clay, N.Y., about a 15-minute drive from downtown Syracuse. Initially, the company will spend $20 billion to build its first plant, which it estimates will require about 5,000 workers for construction and initially employ about 3,000 manufacturing workers. Micron has announced that these jobs will pay an average salary of $100,000—nearly double the region’s current per capita personal income (although the company has not announced expected wages for entry-level jobs). By 2045, if Micron implements its Phase 2 expansion, the company expects to employ roughly 9,000 workers at its facilities. An economic impact analysis estimated that by 2055, those jobs will support roughly 9,000 indirect jobs (workers whose employers are supplying key products and services to Micron) and 32,000 induced jobs (workers whose employers are providing local services in response to increased economic demand). \n",
      "Such growth would mark a significant departure from recent trends in central New York. Regional employment there peaked in 2001, took a major hit during the Great Recession, and today has yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels. But low growth is only one part of the region’s economic challenge; among metro areas with populations of 500,000 to 1 million, Greater Syracuse saw the largest increase in earnings disparities by race between 2009 and 2019, with median incomes growing for white workers but declining for workers of color. \n",
      "These patterns may explain the fervor with which regional and state leaders courted Micron. This summer, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and the legislature passed a new version of the state’s Excelsior Jobs Tax Credit program to attract chip manufacturers. Should Micron hit its intended capital investment, job creation, and research and development targets while delivering on its commitments to sustainability, prevailing wages, and worker and community investments, it will be eligible for approximately $6 billion in state and local incentives—the largest such package in New York’s history. These incentives are not provided as an upfront sum; sources close to the agreement have told Brookings that the company must qualify annually for the tax credits, subject to approval from Empire State Development, the state’s economic development agency. In principle, the idea is to enable the manufacturer to plan with the assurance of public co-investment over time while acknowledging that the specific terms of the agreement are contingent on the company meeting the targets mentioned above (for which a globally competitive marketplace offers no guarantees). \n",
      "Such incentive packages—mostly from state governments but potentially with local subsidies as well—will emerge around every semiconductor investment. The Commerce Department will “prioritize support for projects that include state and local incentive packages” when deciding how to award loans, loan guarantees, and grants from the CHIPS for America Fund.  \n",
      "State and local leaders also deem these incentives necessary, as governments compete with one another for corporate investment. Since some states will use incentives in these competitions, all feel they must. And we should not forget the global scale of the competition. In the semiconductor industry, states like New York are not just bidding against Ohio or Texas, but also against Europe and Asia, which have their own generous subsidies. Of course, it is nearly impossible for government officials to know whether a company needs an incentive to expand or grow jobs, and skeptics of such approaches maintain that incentives are wasteful and regressive because they subsidize companies to do something they would have done anyway. Moreover, observers of business attraction policies have called for greater transparency and accountability in the use of taxpayer-provided subsidies, to mitigate a race-to-the-bottom dynamic between governments and drive measurable benefits for local workers, businesses, and communities. \n",
      "How incentives are targeted, therefore, matters greatly. Economic development expert Tim Bartik has argued that incentives are best targeted to specific, socially beneficial investments such as job training or research and development, and that subsidies should be reserved for companies that create good jobs at livable wages and build regional supply chains in tradable clusters (which tend to offer more advanced skills and higher wages than jobs in the local service economy). Josh Goodman and Khara Boender at the Pew Charitable Trusts recommend that states establish principles and procedures that allow for robust targeting, monitoring, and evaluation of incentives. And in a 2018 Brookings policy brief, economist Aaron Chatterji—now the White House’s point person on CHIPS implementation—called for focused investments in evidence-backed workforce development programs to help residents get good jobs, and targeted entrepreneurial support to grow local companies, including those that could act as suppliers in manufacturing and other high-value-added sectors. Importantly, the Commerce Department’s strategy paper indicates it will favor “state and local incentive packages with the potential for large spill-over benefits, are based on performance, and maximize regional and local competitiveness as well as economic gains, including supporting a robust semiconductor ecosystem rather than a single company.” \n",
      "Defining, operationalizing, and enforcing such corporate commitments to the public good has often been pursued in large-scale, urban real estate development (think new sports or concert arenas), where nonprofit groups or local governments have entered into community benefits agreements (CBAs) with developers. These agreements primarily mean to connect low- and moderate-income workers and suppliers to the projects, but sometimes also to secure concessions; for example, to operate small businesses in and around the newly constructed facilities. CBAs are extremely labor-intensive to negotiate and often quite technical; they also pose the standard challenges of governing in local politics. CBAs must mobilize community voices and align local interest groups, elected leaders, and businesses to craft agreements that are at once aspirational and realistic in economic terms, and also seen as reasonably fair and inclusively decided in procedural terms. \n",
      "CBAs are very new in the arena of domestic manufacturing deals with public investment, which have seen little large-scale federal investment since the space race (other than defense procurement). A landmark multistate CBA announced last year for a electric bus maker’s plants in Alabama and California illustrates what may be achievable in other deals nationwide, especially to promote job quality and ensure access to training and worker protections. \n",
      "What state and local leaders need to know about institutionalizing inclusive growth \n",
      "The CHIPS for America Fund offers a unique opportunity to tailor a public benefits framework, whether via CBAs or other mechanisms, to a key growth industry that is now the backbone of our economy. As previewed above, to receive federal subsidies, semiconductor manufacturers must address several Commerce Department “implementation principles” tied to strengthening regional clusters and supply chains, preparing a diverse workforce, and investing in community-level opportunity. Beyond the provision and monitoring of tax breaks, these inputs require high-capacity local and regional partnerships with businesses to establish new and expanded programs and more coherent and functional civic systems. \n",
      "In Syracuse, the Community Investment Framework that Empire State Development negotiated with Micron (with support from the regional economic development organization CenterState CEO), seeks to address Commerce’s implementation principles through the following elements:  \n",
      "\n",
      "Strengthening regional innovation clusters through a $10 million venture funding investment from Micron in collaboration with the regional tech ecosystem. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Building a robust, inclusive network of suppliers through Micron’s pledge that 30% of eligible construction spend and 20% of ongoing eligible operating spend occurs with businesses owned by people from socially and economically disadvantaged groups. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Preparing a diverse and empowered workforce through Micron’s $10 million investment in the Syracuse STEAM school and other K-12 STEM programs; another $10 million investment from Micron and Onondaga County into a clean room and technical curriculum at Onondaga Community College; Micron’s support for a Workforce Innovation Consortium that builds out the region’s workforce development ecosystem; and Micron’s entry into a project labor agreement with local unions. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Investing in community-building through funding for child care, early learning, STEM exposure, and quarterly community engagement meetings with residents in Clay, Syracuse, and Onondaga County. \n",
      "\n",
      " Micron has pledged $250 million to the Green CHIPS Community Investment Fund over 20 years, and the state of New York has pledged another $100 million, with another $150 million to be raised from local, state, and philanthropic sources. By any number of benchmarks—including recent ambitious federal programs (other than CHIPS) that make big bets on inclusive economic growth in regions—these proposed investment levels are significant and promising. \n",
      "But the $500 million Fund is only part of the potential impact. Should Micron meet its ambitious supply chain pledges, billions in contracts could flow in the years ahead to business owners from historically excluded communities. Should Micron act with urgency to hire regionally and expand the talent pipeline, thousands of local workers could gain access to quality jobs over the next two decades. Ultimately, these outcomes rest on Micron’s good-faith efforts to meet these targets, the state’s willingness to enforce these targets (including by withholding annual tax incentives), and the region’s ability to create and sustain the civic infrastructure needed to make the most out of these targets (more on that below).  \n",
      "Public oversight and accountability will be crucial in this regard. For example, we do not yet know what is in the Micron agreement concerning wage floors and benefits—even if projected annual wages for the planned facility are much higher than the current regional average. The Framework pointed to an 11-member Community Advisory Committee; our hope is such a multi-stakeholder group is not just a pro forma exercise, but that it is both representative of a diverse range of perspectives and empowered to match the Fund’s investments to community needs and opportunities. \n",
      "That last part is easy to overlook—regional civic capacity will need to surge. This sprawling inclusive development agenda requires coordination across a distributed network of implementing organizations, including local governments, schools, colleges and universities, community-based organizations, economic development groups, and entrepreneurship support organizations. In a piece last year, our team unpacked this key ingredient and framed it as “institutionalizing inclusive growth” at the local level. For example, a regional “system hub” can convene organizations across multiple pillars of the regional system to collaboratively invest in initiatives and transparently measure progress. \n",
      "Key questions for the future of regional inclusive growth partnerships \n",
      "Through the CHIPs and Science Act, Congress and the Biden administration established a powerful investment platform with the potential to expand the nation’s productive capacity for decades. Now, the Commerce Department must make a series of decisions about the program’s design and implementation, including a Notice of Funding Opportunity to guide the distribution of the $39 billion to semiconductor companies. A lot rests on the terms in that document—not just what it calls for from applicants, but also how it weighs different elements of their proposals to determine how industry leaders pursue inclusive approaches around workforce, business, and community development. It is a rare moment to catalyze and enable a different form of economic growth, especially for regions that have suffered decline or stagnation as they watched the innovation economy pass them by. \n",
      "From there, federal leaders must rely on local and state implementers—working in collaboration with industry and community—to ensure that this “big build” actually generates widespread economic benefits in the communities that receive these investments. As such, this new era of industrial policy also needs a rebooted and reinvigorated federalism that operates across all levels of government and the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. \n",
      "These regional industry-government-community partnerships should be guided by several key questions: \n",
      "\n",
      "Transparency: Have local and state governments put in place clear commitments to transparency, public reporting, and independent evaluation of publicly provided incentives? \n",
      "Inclusive community investment: In addition to job quality commitments and direct incentives to companies, are there flexible resources to invest in job training, supply chain development, housing, and infrastructure to ensure that growth is both inclusive and sustainable? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Capacity: In preparation for a capital investment boom, can regions muster an accompanying boom in capacity to ensure inclusive, effective delivery? \n",
      "\n",
      "It will be some time before we know whether the Syracuse framework delivers as promised. But it is certainly emblematic of a new regional growth model that is also a new model for the innovation economy as a whole—one that uses catalytic federal funding to unlock private capital and deploy it to generate good jobs, contracting opportunities, and investments in people and place.  \n",

      "URL: Ben Bernanke, distinguished senior fellow in residence, receives Nobel Prize in economic sciences\n",
      "TITLE: \n",
      "WASHINGTON, D.C. – Ben Bernanke, a distinguished senior fellow in residence with the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, is among three winners of this year’s Nobel Prize in economic sciences.  \n",
      "The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2022 to Dr. Bernanke, Douglas Diamond, and Philip Dybvig for significantly improving our understanding of the role of banks in the economy, particularly during financial crises.  \n",
      "“I was delighted to learn that I had received this award. I will accept it on behalf of the many distinguished scholars, including Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig, who have helped us better understand the role the financial system plays in the broader economy,” said Dr. Bernanke after receiving the call.  \n",
      "Modern banking research clarifies why we have banks, how to make them less vulnerable in crises, and how bank collapses exacerbate financial crises. The foundations of this research were laid by Dr. Bernanke, Diamond, and Dybvig in the early 1980s. Dr. Bernanke analyzed the Great Depression of the 1930s, the worst economic crisis in modern history. Among other things, he showed how bank runs were a decisive factor in the crisis becoming so deep and prolonged. This research has been of great importance in regulating financial markets and dealing with financial crises. \n",
      "Stephanie Aaronson, Vice President and Director of the Economic Studies Program at Brookings noted “The work of Ben and the other award winners was a significant academic contribution, improving our understanding of the modern banking system, particularly during times of crisis. But as is the case with the best economic research, it also turned out to have significant policy implications, when, as Chair of the Federal Reserve, Ben was one of the policymakers tasked with leading the response to what was the most severe financial crisis in the United States since the Great Depression. His actions then certainly prevented another depression.”  \n",
      "Dr. Bernanke has published many articles on a wide variety of economic issues, including monetary policy, macroeconomics, and economic history, and he is the author of several scholarly books and two textbooks. \n",
      "Most recently, Dr. Bernanke published “21st Century Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve from the Great Inflation to COVID-19,” explaining the Fed’s evolution over the past seventy years, showing how changes in the economy have driven the Fed’s innovations. He also lays out new challenges confronting the Fed, including the return of inflation, cryptocurrencies, increased risks of financial instability, and threats to its independence.  \n",
      "From February 2006 through January 2014, he was chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, having been appointed to that position by both Presidents Bush and Obama. In 2017, he published “The Courage to Act: A Memoir of a Crisis and Its Aftermath,” recounting the 2008 financial crisis, providing an insider’s account of the policy response. Dr. Bernanke’s other highly cited works include “Measuring the Effects of Monetary Policy: A Factor-augmented Vector Autoregressive (FAVAR) Approach,” in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2005, and “Inflation Targeting: A New Framework for Monetary Policy?” in the Journal of Economic Perspectives in 1997. \n",
      "Dr. Bernanke has held a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Sloan Fellowship, and he is a fellow of the Econometric Society and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He served as the director of the Monetary Economics Program of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and as a member of the NBER’s Business Cycle Dating Committee. In July 2001, Dr. Bernanke was appointed editor of the American Economic Review, the profession’s leading research journal. His work with civic and professional groups includes having served two terms as a member of the Montgomery Township (N.J.) Board of Education. \n",
      "Dr. Bernanke was born in December 1953 in Augusta, Georgia, and grew up in Dillon, South Carolina. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics in 1975 from Harvard University (summa cum laude) and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in economics in 1979 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n",
