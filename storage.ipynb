      "b'CHAPTER I\\n\\n\"Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of theBuonapartes. But I warn you, if you don\\'t tell me that this means war,if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated bythat Antichrist- I really believe he is Antichrist- I will havenothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longermy \\'faithful slave,\\' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I seeI have frightened you- sit down and tell me all the news.\"\\n\\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known AnnaPavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress MaryaFedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a manof high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at herreception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, asshe said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word inSt. Petersburg, used only by the elite.\\n\\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, anddelivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\\n\\n\"If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if theprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not tooterrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10-Annette Scherer.\"\\n\\n\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in theleast disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearingan embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and hadstars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spokein that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke butthought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to aman of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He wentup to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald,scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on thesofa.\\n\\n\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend\\'smind at rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath thepoliteness and affected sympathy of which indifference and evenirony could be discerned.\\n\\n\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in timeslike these if one has any feeling?\" said Anna Pavlovna. \"You arestaying the whole evening, I hope?\"\\n\\n\"And the fete at the English ambassador\\'s? Today is Wednesday. Imust put in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter iscoming for me to take me there.\"\\n\\n\"I thought today\\'s fete had been canceled. I confess all thesefestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\\n\\n\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment wouldhave been put off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, byforce of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev\\'sdispatch? You know everything.\"\\n\\n\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold,listless tone. \"What has been decided? They have decided thatBuonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready toburn ours.\"\\n\\nPrince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating astale part. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her fortyyears, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be anenthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when shedid not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not todisappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smilewhich, though it did not suit her faded features, always playedround her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continualconsciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, norcould, nor considered it necessary, to correct.\\n\\nIn the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovnaburst out:\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don\\'t understandthings, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war.She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracioussovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That isthe one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has toperform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noblethat God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation andcrush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible thanever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone mustavenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we relyon?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannotunderstand the Emperor Alexander\\'s loftiness of soul. She hasrefused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, somesecret motive in our actions. What answer did Novosiltsev get? None.The English have not understood and cannot understand theself-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but onlydesires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! Andwhat little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia hasalways declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europeis powerless before him.... And I don\\'t believe a word that Hardenburgsays, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just atrap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adoredmonarch. He will save Europe!\"\\n\\nShe suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.\\n\\n\"I think,\" said the prince with a smile, \"that if you had beensent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured theKing of Prussia\\'s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will yougive me a cup of tea?\"\\n\\n\"In a moment. A propos,\" she added, becoming calm again, \"I amexpecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart,who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one ofthe best French families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the goodones. And also the Abbe Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? Hehas been received by the Emperor. Had you heard?\"\\n\\n\"I shall be delighted to meet them,\" said the prince. \"But tell me,\"he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurredto him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motiveof his visit, \"is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funketo be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accountsis a poor creature.\"\\n\\nPrince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son, but otherswere trying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure itfor the baron.\\n\\nAnna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither shenor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired orwas pleased with.\\n\\n\"Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by hersister,\" was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.\\n\\nAs she named the Empress, Anna Pavlovna\\'s face suddenly assumed anexpression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled withsadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustriouspatroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show BaronFunke beaucoup d\\'estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.\\n\\nThe prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with thewomanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, AnnaPavlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak he had done ofa man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him,so she said:\\n\\n\"Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter cameout everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazinglybeautiful.\"\\n\\nThe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.\\n\\n\"I often think,\" she continued after a short pause, drawing nearerto the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show thatpolitical and social topics were ended and the time had come forintimate conversation- \"I often think how unfairly sometimes thejoys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendidchildren? I don\\'t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don\\'t likehim,\" she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising hereyebrows. \"Two such charming children. And really you appreciatethem less than anyone, and so you don\\'t deserve to have them.\"\\n\\nAnd she smiled her ecstatic smile.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t help it,\" said the prince. \"Lavater would have said Ilack the bump of paternity.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know Iam dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves\" (and herface assumed its melancholy expression), \"he was mentioned at HerMajesty\\'s and you were pitied....\"\\n\\nThe prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,awaiting a reply. He frowned.\\n\\n\"What would you have me do?\" he said at last. \"You know I did alla father could for their education, and they have both turned outfools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an activeone. That is the only difference between them.\" He said this smilingin a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinklesround his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarseand unpleasant.\\n\\n\"And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not afather there would be nothing I could reproach you with,\" said AnnaPavlovna, looking up pensively.\\n\\n\"I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that mychildren are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. Thatis how I explain it to myself. It can\\'t be helped!\"\\n\\nHe said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by agesture. Anna Pavlovna meditated.\\n\\n\"Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?\"she asked. \"They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, andthough I don\\'t feel that weakness in myself as yet,I know a littleperson who is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation ofyours, Princess Mary Bolkonskaya.\"\\n\\nPrince Vasili did not reply, though, with the quickness of memoryand perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by amovement of the head that he was considering this information.\\n\\n\"Do you know,\" he said at last, evidently unable to check the sadcurrent of his thoughts, \"that Anatole is costing me forty thousandrubles a year? And,\" he went on after a pause, \"what will it be infive years, if he goes on like this?\" Presently he added: \"That\\'s whatwe fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?\"\\n\\n\"Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. Heis the well-known Prince Bolkonski who had to retire from the armyunder the late Emperor, and was nicknamed \\'the King of Prussia.\\' He isvery clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is veryunhappy. She has a brother; I think you know him, he married LiseMeinen lately. He is an aide-de-camp of Kutuzov\\'s and will be heretonight.\"\\n\\n\"Listen, dear Annette,\" said the prince, suddenly taking AnnaPavlovna\\'s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. \"Arrangethat affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe wigh an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. Sheis rich and of good family and that\\'s all I want.\"\\n\\nAnd with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raisedthe maid of honor\\'s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to andfro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.\\n\\n\"Attendez,\" said Anna Pavlovna, reflecting, \"I\\'ll speak to Lise,young Bolkonski\\'s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing canbe arranged. It shall be on your family\\'s behalf that I\\'ll start myapprenticeship as old maid.\"'\n"

      "— Eh bien, mon prince. Gênes et Lucques ne sont plus que des apanages, des поместья, de la famille Buonaparte. Non, je vous préviens que si vous ne me dites pas que nous avons la guerre, si vous vous permettez encore de pallier toutes les infamies, toutes les atrocités de cet Antichrist (ma parole, j'y crois) — je ne vous connais plus, vous n'êtes plus mon ami, vous n'êtes plus мой верный раб, comme vous dites. Ну, здравствуйте, здравствуйте. Je vois que je vous fais peur, садитесь и рассказывайте.\n",
      "Так говорила в июле 1805 года известная Анна Павловна Шерер, фрейлина и приближенная императрицы Марии Феодоровны, встречая важного и чиновного князя Василия, первого приехавшего на ее вечер. Анна Павловна кашляла несколько дней, у нее был грипп, как она говорила (грипп был тогда новое слово, употреблявшееся только редкими). В записочках, разосланных утром с красным лакеем, было написано без различия во всех:\n",
      "«Si vous n'avez rien de mieux à faire, Monsieur le comte (или mon prince), et si la perspective de passer la soirée chez une pauvre malade ne vous effraye pas trop, je serai charmée de vous voir chez moi entre 7 et 10 heures. Annette Scherer».\n",
      "— Dieu, quelle virulente sortie! — отвечал, нисколько не смутясь такою встречей, вошедший князь, в придворном, шитом мундире, в чулках, башмаках и звездах, с светлым выражением плоского лица.\n",
      "Он говорил на том изысканном французском языке, на котором не только говорили, но и думали наши деды, и с теми, тихими, покровительственными интонациями, которые свойственны состаревшемуся в свете и при дворе значительному человеку. Он подошел к Анне Павловне, поцеловал ее руку, подставив ей свою надушенную и сияющую лысину, и покойно уселся на диване.\n",
      "— Avant tout dites-moi, comment vous allez, chère amie? Успокойте меня, — сказал он, не изменяя голоса и тоном, в котором из-за приличия и участия просвечивало равнодушие и даже насмешка.\n",
      "— Как можно быть здоровой... когда нравственно страдаешь? Разве можно, имея чувство, оставаться спокойною в наше время? — сказала Анна Павловна. — Вы весь вечер у меня, надеюсь?\n",
      "— А праздник английского посланника? Нынче середа. Мне надо показаться там, — сказал князь. — Дочь заедет за мной и повезет меня.\n",
      "— Я думала, что нынешний праздник отменен, Je vous avoue que toutes ces fêtes et tous ces feux d'artifice commencent à devenir insipides.\n",
      "— Ежели бы знали, что вы этого хотите, праздник бы отменили, — сказал князь по привычке, как заведенные часы, говоря вещи, которым он и не хотел, чтобы верили.\n",
      "— Ne me tourmentez pas. Eh bien, qu'a-t-on décidé par rapport à la dépêche de Novosilzoff? Vous savez tout.\n",
      "— Как вам сказать? — сказал князь холодным, скучающим тоном. — Qu'a-t-on décidé? On a décidé que Buonaparte a brûlé ses vaisseaux, et je crois que nous sommes en train de brûler les nôtres.\n",
      "Князь Василий говорил всегда лениво, как актер говорит роль старой пиесы. Анна Павловна Шерер, напротив, несмотря на свои сорок лет, была преисполнена оживления и порывов.\n",
      "Быть энтузиасткой сделалось ее общественным положением, и иногда, когда ей даже того не хотелось, она, чтобы не обмануть ожиданий людей, знавших ее, делалась энтузиасткой. Сдержанная улыбка, игравшая постоянно на лице Анны Павловны, хотя и не шла к ее отжившим чертам, выражала, как у избалованных детей, постоянное сознание своего милого недостатка, от которого она не хочет, не может и не находит нужным исправляться.\n",
      "В середине разговора про политические действия Анна Павловна разгорячилась.\n",
      "— Ах, не говорите мне про Австрию! Я ничего не понимаю, может быть, но Австрия никогда не хотела и не хочет войны. Она предает нас. Россия одна должна быть спасительницей Европы. Наш благодетель знает свое высокое призвание и будет верен ему. Вот одно, во что я верю. Нашему доброму и чудному государю предстоит величайшая роль в мире, и он так добродетелен и хорош, что Бог не оставит его, и он исполнит свое призвание задавить гидру революции, которая теперь еще ужаснее в лице этого убийцы и злодея. Мы одни должны искупить кровь праведника. На кого нам надеяться, я вас спрашиваю?.. Англия с своим коммерческим духом не поймет и не может понять всю высоту души императора Александра. Она отказалась очистить Мальту. Она хочет видеть, ищет заднюю мысль наших действий. Что они сказали Новосильцеву? Ничего. Они не поняли, они не могли понять самоотвержения нашего императора, который ничего не хочет для себя и все хочет для блага мира. И что они обещали? Ничего. И что обещали, и того не будет! Пруссия уже объявила, что Бонапарте непобедим и что вся Европа ничего не может против него... И я не верю ни в одном слове ни Гарденбергу, ни Гаугвицу. Cette fameuse neutralité prussienne, ce n'est qu'un piège. Я верю в одного Бога и в высокую судьбу нашего милого императора. Он спасет Европу!.. — Она вдруг остановилась с улыбкой насмешки над своею горячностью.\n",
      "— Я думаю, — сказал князь, улыбаясь, — что, ежели бы вас послали вместо нашего милого Винценгероде, вы бы взяли приступом согласие прусского короля. Вы так красноречивы. Вы дадите мне чаю?\n",
      "— Сейчас. A propos, — прибавила она, опять успокоиваясь, — нынче у меня два очень интересные человека, le vicomte de Mortemart, il est allié aux Montmorency par les Rohans, одна из лучших фамилий Франции. Это один из хороших эмигрантов, из настоящих. И потом l'abbé Morio; вы знаете этот глубокий ум? Он был принят государем. Вы знаете?\n",
      "— А! Я очень рад буду, — сказал князь. — Скажите, — прибавил он, как будто только что вспомнив что-то и особенно-небрежно, тогда как то, о чем он спрашивал, было главной целью его посещения, — правда, что l'impératrice-mère желает назначения барона Функе первым секретарем в Вену? C'est un pauvre sire, ce baron, à ce qu'il paraît. — Князь Василий желал определить сына на это место, которое через императрицу Марию Феодоровну старались доставить барону.\n",
      "Анна Павловна почти закрыла глаза в знак того, что ни она, ни кто другой не могут судить про то, что угодно или нравится императрице.\n",
      "— Monsieur le baron de Funke a été recommandé à l'impératrice-mère par sa sur, — только сказала она грустным, сухим тоном. В то время как Анна Павловна назвала императрицу, лицо ее вдруг представило глубокое и искреннее выражение преданности и уважения, соединенное с грустью, что с ней бывало каждый раз, когда она в разговоре упоминала о своей высокой покровительнице. Она сказала, что ее величество изволила оказать барону Функе beaucoup d'estime, и опять взгляд ее подернулся грустью.\n",
      "Князь равнодушно замолк, Анна Павловна, с свойственною ей придворною и женскою ловкостью и быстротою такта, захотела и щелкануть князя за то, что он дерзнул так отозваться о лице, рекомендованном императрице, и в то же время утешить его.\n",
      "— Mais à propos de votre famille, — сказала она, — знаете ли, что ваша дочь, с тех пор как выезжает, fait les délices de tout le monde. On la trouve belle comme le jour.\n",
      "Князь наклонился в знак уважения и признательности.\n",
      "— Я часто думаю, — продолжала Анна Павловна после минутного молчания, придвигаясь к князю и ласково улыбаясь ему, как будто выказывая этим, что политические и светские разговоры кончены и теперь начинается задушевный, — я часто думаю, как иногда несправедливо распределяется счастие жизни. За что вам дала судьба таких двух славных детей (исключая Анатоля, вашего меньшого, я его не люблю, — вставила она безапелляционно, приподняв брови), — таких прелестных детей? А вы, право, менее всех цените их и потому их не сто́ите.\n",
      "И она улыбнулась своею восторженной улыбкой.\n",
      "— Que voulez-vous? Lafater aurait dit que je n'ai pas la bosse de la paternité, — сказал князь.\n",
      "— Перестаньте шутить. Я хотела серьезно поговорить с вами. Знаете, я недовольна вашим меньшим сыном. Между нами будь сказано (лицо ее приняло грустное выражение), о нем говорили у ее величества и жалеют вас...\n",
      "Князь не отвечал, но она молча, значительно глядя на него, ждала ответа. Князь Василий поморщился.\n",
      "— Что ж мне делать? — сказал он наконец. — Вы знаете, я сделал для их воспитания все, что может отец, и оба вышли des imbéciles. Ипполит, по крайней мере, покойный дурак, а Анатоль — беспокойный. Вот одно различие, — сказал он, улыбаясь более неестественно и одушевленно, чем обыкновенно, и при этом особенно резко выказывая в сложившихся около его рта морщинах что-то неожиданно-грубое и неприятное.\n",
      "— И зачем родятся дети у таких людей, как вы? Ежели бы вы не были отец, я бы ни в чем не могла упрекнуть вас, — сказала Анна Павловна, задумчиво поднимая глаза.\n",
      "— Je suis votre верный раб, et à vous seule je puis l'avouer. Мои дети — ce sont les entraves de mon existence. Это мой крест. Я так себе объясняю. Que voulez-vous?..— Он помолчал, выражая жестом свою покорность жестокой судьбе.\n",
      "Анна Павловна задумалась.\n",
      "— Вы никогда не думали о том, чтобы женить вашего блудного сына Анатоля. Говорят, — сказала она, — что старые девицы ont la manie des mariages. Я еще не чувствую за собою этой слабости, но у меня есть одна petite personne, которая очень несчастлива с отцом, une parente à nous, une princesse Болконская. — Князь Василий не отвечал, хотя с свойственной светским людям быстротой соображения и памятью движением головы показал, что он принял к соображению это сведенье.\n",
      "— Нет, вы знаете ли, что этот Анатоль мне стоит сорок тысяч в год, — сказал он, видимо не в силах удерживать печальный ход своих мыслей. Он помолчал.\n",
      "— Что будет через пять лет, ежели это пойдет так? Voilà l'avantage d'être père. Она богата, ваша княжна?\n",
      "— Отец очень богат и скуп. Он живет в деревне. Знаете, этот известный князь Болконский, отставленный еще при покойном императоре и прозванный прусским королем. Он очень умный человек, но со странностями и тяжелый. La pauvre petite est malheureuse comme les pierres. У нее брат, вот что недавно женился на Lise Мейнен, адъютант Кутузова. Он будет нынче у меня.\n",
      "— Ecoutez, chère Annette, — сказал князь, взяв вдруг свою собеседницу за руку и пригибая ее почему-то книзу. — Arrangez-moi cette affaire et je suis votre вернейший раб à tout jamais (рап — comme mon староста m'écrit des донесенья: покой-ер-п). Она хорошей фамилии и богата. Все, что мне нужно.\n",
      "И он с теми свободными и фамильярными грациозными движениями, которые его отличали, взял за руку фрейлину, поцеловал ее и, поцеловав, помахал фрейлинскою рукой, развалившись на креслах и глядя в сторону.\n",
      "— Attendez, — сказала Анна Павловна, соображая. — Я нынче же поговорю Lise (la femme du jeune Болконский). И, может быть, это уладится. Ce sera dans votre famille que je ferai mon apprentissage de vieille fille.\n"

      "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[33]\n",
      "Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[34][35]\n",
      "Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[36] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision  not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.[37]\n",

      "History\n",
      " The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at OSCON 2006\n",
      "Main article: History of Python\n",
      "Python was conceived in the late 1980s[42] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[43] capable of exception handling (from the start plus new capabilities in Python 3.11) and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[13] Its implementation began in December 1989.[44] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python's \"benevolent dictator for life\", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[45] In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[46][47]\n",
      "Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features.[48] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[49] and 2.7.x.  Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[50]\n",
      "Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[51][52]  No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[53][54] Currently only 3.7 and later are supported. In 2021, Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited[55] as all versions of Python (including 2.7[56]) had security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web cache poisoning.[58]\n",
      "In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, and 3.7.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) will only receive security fixes going forward.[61] On September 7, 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]\n",
      "As of November 2022,[update] Python 3.11.0 is the current stable release and among the notable changes from 3.10 are that it is 10–60% faster and significantly improved error reporting.[64]\n",
      "Python 3.12 (alpha 2) has improved error messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Removals from Python\n",
      "The deprecated smtpd module has been removed from Python 3.12 (alpha). And a number of other old, broken and deprecated functions (e.g. from unittest module), classes and methods have been removed. The deprecated wstr and wstr_ length members of the C implementation of Unicode objects were removed,[65] to make UTF-8 the default in later Python versions.\n",
      "Historically, Python 3 also made changes from Python 2, e.g. changed the division operator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Design philosophy and features\n",
      "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming[66] and metaobjects).[67] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[68][69] and logic programming.[70]\n",
      "Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[71] It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\n",
      "Its design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[72] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[73]\n",
      "Its core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[74]\n",
      "\n",
      "Beautiful is better than ugly.\n",
      "Explicit is better than implicit.\n",
      "Simple is better than complex.\n",
      "Complex is better than complicated.\n",
      "Readability counts.\n",
      "Rather than building all of its functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.[42]\n",
      "Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, Python embraces a \"there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it\"  philosophy.[74] Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, wrote: \"To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"[75]\n",
      "Python's developers strive to avoid premature optimization and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[76] When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C; or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.\n",
      "Python's developers aim for it to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[77]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as the use of the terms \"spam\", and \"eggs\" (a reference to a Monty Python sketch) in examples, instead of the often-used \"foo\", and \"bar\".[78][79]\n",
      "A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a wide range of meanings related to program style. \"Pythonic\" code may use Python idioms well, be natural or show fluency in the language, or conform with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. Code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.[80][81]\n",
      "Python users and admirers, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonistas.[82][83]\n",
      "\n",
      "Syntax and semantics\n",
      "Main article: Python syntax and semantics\n",
      "Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.[84]\n",
      "\n",
      "Indentation\n",
      "Main article: Python syntax and semantics § Indentation\n",
      "Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[85] Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure.[86] This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.[87]\n",
      "\n",
      "Statements and control flow\n",
      "Python's statements include:\n",
      "\n",
      "The assignment statement, using a single equals sign =\n",
      "The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if)\n",
      "The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block\n",
      "The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true\n",
      "The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses (or new syntax except* in Python 3.11 for exception groups[88]); it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block is always run regardless of how the block exits\n",
      "The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception\n",
      "The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming\n",
      "The def statement, which defines a function or method\n",
      "The with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before it is run, then releasing the lock; or opening and closing a file), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom[89]\n",
      "The break statement, which exits a loop\n",
      "The continue statement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next\n",
      "The del statement, which removes a variable—deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined\n",
      "The pass statement, serving as a NOP, syntactically needed to create an empty code block\n",
      "The assert statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply\n",
      "The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function (and also an operator); used to implement coroutines\n",
      "The return statement, used to return a value from a function\n",
      "The import and from statements, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program\n",
      "The assignment statement (=) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically-allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing—in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.\n",
      "Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Van Rossum, it never will.[90][91] However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python's generators.[92] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, it can be passed through multiple stack levels.[93]\n",
      "\n",
      "Expressions\n",
      "Python's expressions include:\n",
      "\n",
      "The +, -, and * operators for mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication are similar to other languages, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python: floor division (or integer division) // and floating-point/division.[94] Python uses the ** operator for exponentiation.\n",
      "Python uses the + operator for string concatenation. Python uses the * operator for duplicating a string a specified number of times.\n",
      "The @ infix operator. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.[95][96]\n",
      "The syntax :=, called the \"walrus operator\", was introduced in Python 3.8. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.[97]\n",
      "In Python, == compares by value. Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference), and comparisons may be chained—for example, a <= b <= c.\n",
      "Python uses and, or, and not as boolean operators.\n",
      "Python has a type of expression called a list comprehension, as well as a more general expression called a generator expression.[72]\n",
      "Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, there may be only one expression in each body.\n",
      "Conditional expressions are written as x if c else y[98] (different in order of operands from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages).\n",
      "Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples, written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as keys of dictionaries, provided all of the tuple's elements are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but produces a new tuple containing the elements of both. Thus, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which is then assigned back to t—thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" of t while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.[99]\n",
      "Python features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned (to a variable, writable property, etc.) are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals—and, as a whole, are put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions; when iterated through them, it assigns each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.[100]\n",
      "Python has a \"string format\" operator % that functions analogously to printf format strings in C—e.g. \"spam=%s eggs=%d\" % (\"blah\", 2) evaluates to \"spam=blah eggs=2\". In Python 2.6+ and 3+, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. \"spam={0} eggs={1}\".format(\"blah\", 2). Python 3.6 added \"f-strings\": spam = \"blah\"; eggs = 2; f'spam={spam} eggs={eggs}'.[101]\n",
      "Strings in Python can be concatenated by \"adding\" them (with the same operator as for adding integers and floats), e.g. \"spam\" + \"eggs\" returns \"spameggs\". If strings contain numbers, they are added as strings rather than integers, e.g. \"2\" + \"2\" returns \"22\".\n",
      "Python has various string literals:\n",
      "Delimited by single or double quote marks; unlike in Unix shells, Perl, and Perl-influenced languages, single and double quote marks work the same. Both use the backslash (\\) as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as \"formatted string literals\".[101]\n",
      "Triple-quoted (beginning and ending with three single or double quote marks), which may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl, and Ruby.\n",
      "Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with r. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and Windows-style paths. (Compare \"@-quoting\" in C#.)\n",
      "Python has array index and array slicing expressions in lists, denoted as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted—for example, a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.\n",
      "In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "List comprehensions vs. for-loops\n",
      "Conditional expressions vs. if blocks\n",
      "The eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in Python 2, exec is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements\n",
      "Statements cannot be a part of an expression—so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ... } is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code, but if c = 1: ... causes a syntax error in Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "Methods on objects are functions attached to the object's class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, Ruby).[102] Python also provides methods, often called dunder methods (due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores), to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations including length, comparison, in arithmetic operations and type conversion.[103]\n",

      "Typing\n",
      " The standard type hierarchy in Python 3\n",
      "Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that it is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.\n",
      "Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, most often used for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection.\n",
      "Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes (both using the same syntax): old-style and new-style,[104] current Python versions only support the semantics new style.\n",
      "The long-term plan is to support gradual typing.[105] Python's syntax allows specifying static types, but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type-checker, mypy, supports compile-time type checking.[106]\n",

      "In Python terms, / is true division (or simply division), and // is floor division. / before version 3.0 is classic division.[111]\n",
      "Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. It also means that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a%b is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.[112]\n",
      "Python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python 3 uses round to even: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2.[113] Versions before 3 used round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is −1.0.[114]\n",
      "Python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c.[115] C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.[116]\n",

It ships with most Linux distributions,[210] AmigaOS 4 (using Python 2.7), FreeBSD (as a package), NetBSD, and OpenBSD (as a package) and can be used from the command line (terminal). Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer, while Red Hat Linux and Fedora Linux use the Anaconda installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system, Portage.\n",
      "Python is used extensively in the information security industry, including in exploit development.[211][212]\n",
      "Most of the Sugar software for the One Laptop per Child XO, developed at Sugar Labs since 2008, is written in Python.[213] The Raspberry Pi single-board computer project has adopted Python as its main user-programming language.\n",
      "LibreOffice includes Python and intends to replace Java with Python. Its Python Scripting Provider is a core feature[214] since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.\n",

      "Languages influenced by Python\n",
      "Python's design and philosophy have influenced many other programming languages:\n",
      "\n",
      "Boo uses indentation, a similar syntax, and a similar object model.[215]\n",
      "Cobra uses indentation and a similar syntax, and its Acknowledgements document lists Python first among languages that influenced it.[216]\n",
      "CoffeeScript, a programming language that cross-compiles to JavaScript, has Python-inspired syntax.\n",
      "ECMAScript/JavaScript borrowed iterators and generators from Python.[217]\n",
      "GDScript, a scripting language very similar to Python, built-in to the Godot game engine.[218]\n",
      "Go is designed for the \"speed of working in a dynamic language like Python\"[219] and shares the same syntax for slicing arrays.\n",
      "Groovy was motivated by the desire to bring the Python design philosophy to Java.[220]\n",
      "Julia was designed to be \"as usable for general programming as Python\".[29]\n",
      "Nim uses indentation and similar syntax.[221]\n",
      "Ruby's creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto, has said: \"I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language.\"[222]\n",
      "Swift, a programming language developed by Apple, has some Python-inspired syntax.[223]\n",
      "Python's development practices have also been emulated by other languages. For example, the practice of requiring a document describing the rationale for, and issues surrounding, a change to the language (in Python, a PEP) is also used in Tcl,[224] Erlang,[225] and Swift.[226]\n",
